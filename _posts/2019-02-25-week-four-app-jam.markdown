**The Odd Word Out**<br>
Line up the words in your cross-hair<br>
But only shoot if your target is the **odd word out**!<br>
Only shoot if your target is stinking up the place!<br><br>

The idea of this game is to single out the word that is not related to the _main_ word, or, naturally, to any of the other words that appear and disappear.<br>
The effect of the words shimmering into existence for a short while before disappearing into the ether, shouldb be mesmerasing, hypnotic, thythmic, pulsating - like a light-house, punctually sending out its message of warning to those in potential jeopardy.<br><br>
