# Geo-location
# Rumbled – haptic feedback
# Symphony Park – Mixed-use development park in Nevada, museums, arts, academic institutions, green neighbourhoods project
# Kaleh Ser – a small town in Iran.
 - i.e. two (very) different places for which a long journey would be necessary. Information and knowledge about them gained only from resources such as Wikipedia.

# Idea #1

Thinking about escalating situations, build-up of pressure. Like a motorway, problems with traffic flow and build-up.
Led me to thinking about the journey itself and the kind of stress driving long distances can cause, particularly with a young family. Use distraction to draw attention away from the tedium and towards something fun, interesting and educational: -
•	Idea for an app that tracks a road trip, picking up interesting information about the places being passed.
•	The trip could potentially also be planned in advance so data could be used to prepare for the journey with specific ‘events’ to take place at particular points along the trip.
•	Maybe an educational app where the kids could be provided with information and then quizzed on them.
•	Encourage conversation in the vehicle.
•	Could follow journey on a map and highlight places and sights etc as they are approached and passed.
•	Could potentially gamify the journey itself

# Idea #2

Moving Idea #1 forward, the app would: -
•	help coordinate the meeting up of individuals.
•	The app could suggest destinations that would be voted on by the participants,
•	Would also suggest hotels, restaurants, pubs, events etc.
•	Booking for transport and meeting venues could be undertaken via the app.
•	The journeys could be coordinated allowing the time traveling to be used positively, such as using information about places en route and at destination to inform, encourage conversation, or be used in quizzes, games etc.
•	Could gamify the combined journeys.

# Idea #3

Also using Idea #1 as a starting point, the app becomes more of pure game: -
•	Use the road ahead of the car as the basis of a game for the kids in the back
•	A camera (e.g. GoPro) on the dashboard would transmit the image of the road ahead onto the passengers’ device screens or AR headsets.
•	Passengers could play games, such as firing rockets at other cars or bouncing a giant rabbit along the road and over bridges etc.
•	Geo-location could inform the kind of activity, media or warn of up-coming objects or points of interest, such as roundabouts, bridges, towns, historical sites etc.
•	Ultimately would use Augmented Reality, geo-location and haptic feedback for a full immersive experience.

# Idea #4

I bit of a divergence, in that
•	two people would use geo-location to inform haptic and other types of sensory feedback in order to locate each other in a (presumably open) space.
•	This would form the basis of a game where stress and pressure would be created by one player planting virtual bombs whist the other would relieve pressure by defusing the bombs before they go off.
•	Geo-location would pinpoint the players and the bombs by translating into, for instance: -
•	Haptic feedback - indicating distance
•	Audible ‘sonar’ - indicating direction
•	Potentially Augmented/mixed Reality could be used to show virtual ticking bombs and explosions when close.
•	Lots of possibilities for different kinds of game-play –
o	Bomber vs Defuser
o	Each player acting as both Bomber and Defuser
o	Bomber Team  
o	Defuser Team
