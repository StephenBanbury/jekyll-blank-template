It is at this point, i.e. when confronted with the Verb, Noun and Adjective rendomly selected for this project, that I am *allowed* to explore the meanings and relative directions my imagination may take me once exposed to these words. I am  not allowed to write any code. 

Here I will jot down my initial thoughts as they apear in my head as reponses to these words, individually and jointly, and following these I will begin to explore any further words, ideas, reactions and responses that are generated from these.

## VNA
* Withdraw – end with no winner, pyrrhic victory, where good intentions have a significant toll.
* Police – a ‘peace force’, calming down potentially stressful situations, preventative measures, defusing situations, pressure valve.
* Difficult – problematic situation made easier


# Withdraw 

Withdrawal
To take back

Etymology: from with + drawen (to draw)

With: -
Original sense - Old English – against, opposite, from. 
Proto-German, Old Norse, Gothic, Middle Dutch, Sanskrit (vitaram, further, farther).
Shifted in Middle English to association, combination, union - replaced mid (‘with’) now only used as prefix, e.g. midwife. 
Original sense is retained in compounds such as withhold, withdraw, withstand.

Draw: -
Drawing room – 1640’s short for withdrawing room
draw-chamber – in the sense of ‘private room’
Some speculate that the term draw, as in ‘game or contest that ends without a winner’, is from withdraw, to leave a game undecided.
Removal of money from a bank
Physical reaction to the cessation of an addictive substance
Synonym for coitus interruptus 
Colloquial: Draw a crowd

# My initial workings on this:
Some speculate that, etymologically, the term draw is derived or stems from withdraw, i.e. to leave a game undecided, as in ‘game or contest that ends without a winner’ (https://www.etymonline.com/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.)
I started to look at the idea of games where there is no winner. Clearly, if there is no winner, there is also no loser. Or maybe everyone is a winner or everyone is a loser.
It’s a no-win situation.
As in a Pyrrhic victory – in which a military victory is so costly that the winning side actually ends up worse off than before it started.
A Pyrrhic victory is a victory that inflicts such a devastating toll on the victor that it is tantamount to defeat. Someone who wins a Pyrrhic victory has also taken a heavy toll that negates any true sense of achievement. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.)
Maybe a game of hide-and-seek, in which the game police has to ‘spoil’ the game by warning the hider that the seeker is ‘on to them’.
Maybe a shooting game when the police / snipers shoot the attackers – when they have been seen to have the upper hand in warfare. The attackers may still win, but it would be a pyrrhic victory.
Or maybe the police would try to even things out and force a draw by putting up obstacles to help those who are under attack.
And so on..

# Thinking about Police
The Welsh for police is Heddlu (pronounced hair-th-lee, with the 'th' as in 'the'), which stems from Hedd, meaning peace or tranquillity.
So the Welsh for police literally means 'peace force' or 'tranquillity force'. 
So  I started thinking about saving someone / some people from inflicting upon themselves the kind of 'devastating toll' that results from a pyrrhic victory.
i.e. saving them from themselves. 
Following this, I started thinking about 'feedback loops', where something starts happening and gradually increases in 'volume', the action or the effect grows and continues to grow, to amplify, until it is almost uncontrollable. The task would be to calm it down before too much damage is done. If there were an increasing number of these occurrences, like fires or mayhem breaking out all over the place, it would become progressively more difficult to stay on top of it and to achieve calm, tranquillity, serenity.
