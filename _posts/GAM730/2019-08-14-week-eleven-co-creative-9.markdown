**14/08/2019**
I have been away for almost a week now. I produced a working prototype of the Mudita client app before I left, along with the video demonstrating it and outlining future developments.
It is disappointing to see that no movement has been made on the physical web front. On 6th August I showed Yosef how to use postman to at least get a post request sent to the Mudita server to prove any problems he was having were not due to his internet. He said he was going to take it up and thanked me for the help. I assumed he'd be able to move on with it. It now seems there have been no posts to the server apart from mine. Sam has now also tested and it works for him. So where are Yosef's? I've been kind so far, but really, there has been almost zero input from the Agent Y. No input in terms of ideas, no input in terms of suggestions or insights, no input in terms of moving existing ideas forward. There have been complaints that he has had to do stuff on his own and not had clear guidance from his team members in terms of teaching him how to do what he agreed to do. But we are all having to do what we each agreed to do and learn, where necessary, how to do it. We are not there to learn how to do what Y agreed to do, for Y, in order to teach Y.
Even saying this, Sam had tried. And my last contact with Y on Slack was to show him how to install and use Postman in order to sent a http post to the mudita server. I did this using text and images of my own set up. He seems overjoyed and sugegsted he'd run with this new knowledge. However, a week on and there has been no further updates and no posts to Mudita. I can't see what has been going on this week. Although I did notice some complaints on Slack about how something or other hadn't been explained to him. It's hard to follow what the issue is.
