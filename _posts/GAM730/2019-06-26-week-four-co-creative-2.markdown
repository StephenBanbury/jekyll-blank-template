Real problems with communication. Not sure if Y has understood fully what his tasks are. More importantly does he really have a role that will enable him to engage with the project and the team? His own interests are not really represented here. Although we have been open with our thinking and our dialogue there has not been a full and sustained level of communication and real engagement between S and me on the one side with P to and a much greater with Y.

S tried hard to maintain the focus in his brief discussion with Y but it was becoming clear that he does not have much of a gounding in the concept of collaborate work or its tools, such as GitHub and Trello. 

Y is supposed to be working with P on drawing up designs for the UI, but there has not been any such collaboration and the pages we saw was simple pre-HTML5 markup using instances of FRAMESET to 'host' the actual pages being displayed by the app. However this is not necessary, whereas at least wireframes and designs for the UI and for content pages are.

This is the single glimpse of the work done so far, a task made harder by the lack of ability to sign up and work with us on github.

**I think I need to explain Angular better - maybe I haven't done as well here as I could.**

Paulo's user flow chart appeared on draw.io. I can't access it. I've used draw.io briefly at work. It does a job and results can look quite good, but I find it a bit fiddly to use. If it was easy to share then this would be less of an issue.

I've been thinking it's a shame we have not been able to work in a more strict agile fashion, with regular daily scrums and spring retrospect and spring planning etc. Not sure how we can.

If we were in better and more regular contact as a team we could discuss where issues occur, what can be improved, how best to move all these things forward
But we're not  - not sure if it can be improved, but would be good if we could

Issues discussed daily would hopefully be resolved one way or another.
Yosef is probably going down a road that is not necessary. We need designs really, not pages to hold them. An overall look for the UI and individual content pages

Not sure myself if I need to crack on at the moment or take some time to go through course material and log etc. One thing I need to do is re-familiarise myself with the rubric and the timetable etc!
