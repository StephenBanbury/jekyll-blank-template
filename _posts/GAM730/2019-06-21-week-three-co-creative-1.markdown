Everyone waiting with a certain nervousness to see who they'd be put with, in the knowledge that different personalities and experience and interests would have a large bearing on the way the project unfolds.

Introduction to team - my team-mates: -

Sam Samllman
Paulo Resende
Yosef Yahudah - Yisrael

Sam and I know each other from GAM710, get on fine, have some similar interests as reasonably experienced coders but different frameworks - Sam = Apple, me = Microsoft .NET / javascript / angular etc.

Paulo and Yosef we needed to get to know.

Notes made 19/06/2019

Whilst it would be interesting to know why we have been brought together into a team, I don’t really want to dwel too long on this as we just need to make the most of what we can all offer and ‘bring to the party’. 
Sam, whom I know from GAM710, seems keen on practical but innovative solutions to everyday tasks, problems, working practice etc. Background in theatre lighting – Stamp being a very interesting product he has created and is commercially active on the market. 

Paulo is a designer who appears to have skills in imaginatively creating visual representations of his ideas..
Yoseph is an engineer - practical, electronics, physical, Artificial Intelligence.
Me – web-based programming, back-end, preferably front-end, AR, VR, wanting to play with user interactions, geolocation, connectivity etc. 

The main coders are Sam and myself, it seems (?).

Most discussions have so far been between Sam and me. Paulo is busy at the moment due to work but will be fully available for a week at some point soon. He’s done some great work with the App Jam and is keen to use his ideas, which is very much narrative based and very visual. I also have some narrative as I was going with my bomb-defuser idea, using geolocation, haptics and sound, which cross-over with Sam’s AppJam ideas. Yoseph is a bit more of an enigma. He hasn’t been available much so far.  
Clearly there are going to be problems where some are more able to get involved than others from the outset. We need to get this up and running as a project as soon as possible and we set up Slack from the outset in order to achieve communication, to get to know each other and push ideas around. So far this has mostly been Sam and me. Paulo has dipped in when he can. Yoseph is more elusive. As a result Sam and I have begun running with an idea and, when Paulo has been available, tried to open up for him to put his stamp on it. This is obviously problematic – as much as we’d like to be fully inclusive, we also have time pressures. So we have found it necessary to work on formulating ideas during the time we have been available, which has mostly been the two of us. There would have been little point waiting all day for someone to come online with time to interact -if they had been available, presumably they would have been there. So we’ve moved ahead with our ideas and hope input from the others will have the purpose of enhancing these ideas. They cannot be allowed to move too much in directions that deviate from the path set out, as we simply do not have the time.
We also do not have the time to try to include tech that we do not already know, collectively or individually. There has been much made of a general interest in AR, for example, but no-one really has any usable experience to draw upon and we do not have the time to investigate and learn new technologies. So we decided to keep it fairy simple and within the bounds of what we are comfortable with – that’s not to say we only will use what we already actually knjow and have experience with, but to push our abilities and knowledge only as far as we feel is possible in the context of this project, its ambitions, expectations and its limitations.
Sam and I set up GitHub repos for the project as well as GitKraken Glo Boards for project management. These are linked to Slack. Paulo came in later in the day but Yosef is yet to be sorted – not even sure if he has a GitHup account.
Sam has initiated the repo for the server side app with Laravel
I have initiated the repo for the client side app with Angular.

Saturday June 16th 2019 - Sam set up the team channel in Slack, plus team channels for the whole cohort.

Our initial conversations were about our app jam projects and what we had been trying to do with them.

Paulo came on early and discussed his app jam project ideation - an AR game with a 'hacker' narrative. He had done some really nice and professional-looking graphics using Adobe XD and storyboarded the idea with a video. He has interest in C# and Unity.

Paulo has little coding experience but seems to be interesated in design and game / app ideation and development. He uses graphic programs like photoshop, maya etc. Has BSc in Computing IT and Design.

Sam had been working with maps, tracking location, pinging that location on a map and storing it in a list.

I had also been interested and working with geolocation, and wanted to use haptics and sound as feedback for understanding location and proximity.

We began talking about how to bring these together and use our app jam ideas and interests.

We discussed our availability. There are bound to be some difficulties with Paulo working nights for days on end before having days free to work on the project. Initial ideation would be problematic because of the difficulties with communication under these restrictions. 

Sam and I began discussing the kind of thing we'd like to do. Perhaps we exaggerated the necessary haste in our minds, but we began with an idea that encompassed some of the knowledge both of use had been looking at during the app jam - geolocation, haptics, geo-tagging, geo event triggers etc. 

We talked about keeping complex visuals to a minimum and being very refined and clear and polished about how our experiential devices would work in terms of achieving the aims - i.e. vibration, aural, visual indicators, but to stay away from the tempation to incorporate complex visuals and AR.  

# Sam's idea
>So here's an idea: A GPS Location/Event Builder App - A user wants to build a guided tour for their city. or a hacker club wants to build an experience that makes them feel like there some bad ass hackers roaming around the city. The user creates an event, uploaded locations and sound files and then can invite people to that event. There is a companion app that allows other users to log into the event they've been invited to. This downloads the locations and sounds and allows the users to run with the experience.
So each location could have a a sound that would play when you get to the location, a picture that would show or a specific vibration.
Theme is pretty open to the event organises. so lets say for each location there is an optional sound, vibration, text. All of this is pulled as a JSON from the web server.

I liked this idea. I liked the flexibility of something that could be used in many situations by different types of organisations / groups etc. From setting up your own game to a historical tour. We would be 'facilitators', in the way that, again as Sam put it:

>companies that have been successful by not actually owning the actual thing they're selling. Uber has no cars, just eat doesn't own any restaurants, airbnb no hotels, an event app has no events..

The idea, we believed, would be something that all of us could get behind - Paulo could make his hacker game, I could build a haptics and audio geolocating experience and Yosef could maybe build a hardware device that could be used to locate a physical device. Yosef was proving slightly elusive at this point, so there was a certain amount of speculation here, based on what we'd heard on previous group webinars before our team had been formed.

Sam, Paulo and I discussed the possibilites presented by AR. Whilst AR holds a fascination for us all, particulary Paulo and me, we agreed it would be best left alone at this point and only included as an idea for future development. None of us have any real experience in AR and we would lose focus on the simple principles and aims of our idea for an app if we were to spend time forcing it upon the project at an early stage.

I informed my team at this point that I would be away from the country for two weeks from 7th August, i.e. week 10. My team are happy that we can work with this as it is after our first assignment. 

Yosef came in at this point and introduced himself. He said he had some minor experience with Unity and C# but more with C and C++ in hardware environment. When asked if he was happy with the idea put forward and wanted to add anything, including bringing in a hardware element, such as arduino or something, he said he's happy with this as he's an all-round engineer not just hardware.
Yosef suggested he would like to use AI if possible. 

Decided web-based due to overall skills.


Perhaps we should have been less hasty. The concern is that not everyone, particularly Yosef, it getting his fulfilment.
He did have a say and had oporunities to discuss and said his piece, but I feel he's not getting enough out of this.
