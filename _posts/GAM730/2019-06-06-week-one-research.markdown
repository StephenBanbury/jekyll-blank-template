AR 1.0 - basic stuff, 2008, games where monsters pop out of cards etc.
AR 2.0 - mapping body in space etc. sense shape of world around, track position of player with space.

Qualcomm

AR 1.0 is limited. Have to show card to camera / phone. This is like the first part of the Unity course I have begun.

AR 2.0 uses sensors etc specifically designed for AR. Rather than than what was available at the time.

These being:
Wto major algorithms: -
SLAM - tracking position of 'player', device, build map
Depth Mapping - 3D model built from world around

# SLAM - Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping
Coordinating movement of two tablets in same space.
From robotics
Needs a lot of features to lock onto - 'a messy room is better than a clean room'
Motion blur, lighting problems, movement in room causes problems.

# Depth camera - 
Placement of objects (traps) on floor
New tech, getting better

# Persistence -
Object remain in world, synced between devices
Best when using a 'trackable' enviroment - still limitations and difficultlies overcoming this issue


# Next Generation Wearable Platforms
Game - **Heavy Rain**
HoloLens

Hand-tracking - fully articulated
'Mixed reality home'
hologram can respond to hand movement (!!)
eye tracking
virtual walls
great potential

## Physical Web Apps

[Implementing the physical web using Bluetooth low energy based beacons and a mobile app](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7542300)

>**Abstract**
It looks amazing as we are approaching the next big tech revolution of Internet of things, where billions of devices (sensors) would be connected to internet. But it seems unrealistic that to interact with each smart device, user would have to download a separate mobile/tablet application. In this paper we have come with an approach to deal with this issue using beacons.

>Physical web is a concept which enables the core power of the web: interaction on demand. In a physical web enabled ecosystem people would be able to interact to any smart device -a poster, a vending machine, a bus stop, a rental cab and they need not to download a separate app for each of them.

>In physical web we would have a common application for interaction with all smart devices.

A network of 'beacons' - tiny bluetooth radios. App on phone scans for beacons.

Phone could receive alerts and allow actions such as unlocking doors, setting the lighting etc as you move around the house. Or you could be billed for amount of time using a facility such as your gym.

Technically detailed paper, exploring one proposed solution, including physical connecting technology - bluetooth transmitters - and the phone app, including protocols and security etc. for connectivity. Includes a proposal for URLs to be served rather than applications for each device.

>**Conclusion** <br>
Physical Web is an approach of Internet of Things which brings the feature of interaction on demand i.e. user can interact with the surrounding objects such as vending machine, parking meters, shopping stores, by just walking towards them, they need not to download a separate app for each of them.

# My response
Interesting concept for a way of connecting to the _Network of Things_. The possibilities stemming from this kind of platform is really interesting. Consider that the technology is connected to the internet, to each other, and to our phones/devices. Posiblities for serving up simple web pages, interacting via web UI, to interactive Augmented Reality. Just on a phone screen this is exciting, but imagine when using with something like [HoloLens 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIHPPtPBgHk). 
Perhaps locating the position of the device, therefore the person, could potentially be more accurate than GPS alone, as it would oncorporate with this each beacon's approximations of the phone's distance from it. The Virtual space that could be created for the user could potentially be fairly complex and detailed. And the interface with each of the objects and devices in the network could take on forms that are not governed by the physical nature or position of the object, device, appliance etc. 

Total Recal ?
Back to the Future.
