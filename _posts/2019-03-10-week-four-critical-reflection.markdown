title: Week Four - Critical Reflection
published: true
---

Keeping my Personal Case Study under five minutes was not easy. I now look at the content, watch the video, and cannot help but think it's perhaps too light, in particular, on _depth of analysis_ and _self-criticism_. This was in large part down to having to continually cut my content in order to fit within the time limit, and maybe not cutting as well as I could have. Of course, if I had spoken faster then I could have fit more in, possibly without losing too much in terms of it being comfortable to listen to. In the end my video editing skills, which were non-existent before this, and not much better now, have prevented me from finding the perfect level of conciseness.  However, I certainly have learned a lot about how to approach - or how **not** to approach - such a task and will be better for it next time.

Below is the essence of my Personal Case Study. The video can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlmEWzEE1oU).

**The reason I am on the Creative App Development MA course** is due to my interests in both creative practice, particularly music and sound, and software development. I am excited by the sense of exploration and discovery associated with continual technological advancements, particularly in the areas of web and mobile development, inter-connectivity, virtual and augmented reality and sound creation.

**Why my first two projects have been games, and why I am enjoying it**<br>
Although I did not embark on the MA in order to become a game developer, I am surprised to have concluded that games can be a useful vehicle for trying out ideas, techniques and technologies. They encourage thinking about how apps can work in terms of engaging people and holding their interest. I believe the interactive and compulsive nature of good game design has much to offer the non-gaming world; in short, cross-overs exist, and these  I would like to explore.

I formed this opinion through a process of reflection during both the Rapid Ideation and the App Jam activities. The importance of reflection is becoming clear to me – that is, that technical and creative skills alone are not enough. For example, during the App Jam, by continually questioning my progress and adjusting my goals, I was encouraged to move away from my early ideas, which I ultimately decided were quite dull. Instead, I sensed that an animated, arcade-style game play and sense of jeopardy would add a new level of interest to what had hitherto been an intellectual exercise played out in the browser. I now see a huge potential for developing arcade-style word games. 

![Angular Framework](\images\angular-logo-full-word.PNG\)

**My JavaScript framework of choice**<br>
Over the past few years, the power of web-based applications has been moving from the server and into the browser, leading to more reactive and dynamic applications, such as single page apps, and I have developed an interest in JavaScript, the language of the browser, but I have limited experience and confidence in client-side development. Of the existing JavaScript frameworks and libraries, I decided to learn Angular.  From my own background in Microsoft .NET, C# and SQL Server, I find the structured, strongly-typed and object-oriented nature of **TypeScript** to be more approachable than pure JavaScript. Angular is also more _suitable for complex applications that use services and data connections_.

# Making my goals **SMART**
<span style="color:darkblue">**S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**ttainable, **R**elevant, **T**ime-based</span>

In terms of the kind of apps I would like to produce, I did not start the course with any specific goals in mind. I would like to maintain an experimental and explorative approach, but I need to begin focusing on actual ideas that I can consider taking forward. During the App Jam I was surprised how quickly I was able to move from a simple idea to putting a concept into actual code. A moment came where it dawned on me that _I had exhausted the process of ideation and I just needed to get on with building the app._ 

The concept of the _SMART_ goal acronym has actually been slightly surprising, in that it is more useful than I initially realised. The concept has helped me to focus and clarfy the means by which I hope to achieve my goals.  In fact, more than that, I am finding it actually helps to define those goals in the first place. I suppose, it is only logical that **it is not really possible to analyse _how_ you will achieve something if at first you have not worked out _what it is_ you wish to achieve!**
<br><br>

<span style="color:darkblue">**Goal One**</span>

* **Make it specific:** In the knowledge that this can be a rapid process, I intend to set myself a SMART goal to spend several hours each week exploring ideas, one of which I will take forward as a development concept for the next suitable project. 

* **Make it Measureable:** I will set aside regular times leading up to Easter, i.e. six weeks, in order to create one idea per week.  

* **Make it Attainable:** A problem I must overcome is the quality of my working environment.  Due to the demands and noise levels produced by a young family, I often need to work at unsociable hours, with all the associated issues of tiredness and concentration levels. Therefore, it is important for me to find periods of quality development time. So, in consultation with my family, at the start of each week I will schedule two, two-hour slots, at a premium time of the day, that can be guaranteed to be distraction-free. 

* **Make it Relevant:** At the end of the period I will pick one idea that I can take forward for my next project 

* **Make it Time-based:** I will have achieved this outcome at the successful conclusion of the six-week period.
<br><br>

<span style="color:darkblue">**Goal Two**</span>

Another goal surrounds the research of technologies to fill holes in my knowledge and help me develop the gamic qualities I mentioned earlier. 

* **Make it specific:** I would like to explore available technologies and techniques towards animating graphics and moving user-controlled game-style characters around the browser page.

* **Make it Measureable:** For this, I will undertake weekly research and follow relevant courses. Each week’s findings I will document in my weekly journal, where I will discuss their relevance to my work and goals.

* **Make it Attainable:** I have access to many resources, including Pluralsight, Udemy, Lynda and YouTube, which I will use as and when required.

* **Make it Relevant:** I will begin using this research during the first development project after Easter.

* **Make it Time-based:** This I will do over the six weeks available leading up to Week 12.

<span style="color:darkblue">**Future goals**</span>

The act of putting together SMART goals has helped me focus on other goals that I would like to characterise in a similar way. Briefly they include: -
* Bringing myself up to a good confident speed with 
  - Angular and TypeScript
  - HTML5 and CSS
* Spend time investigating
  - mobile platforms: - 
    - cross-platform: NativeScript, Ionic, Flutter 
    -  iOS - Swift
    -  Android - Java
  - sound generation: I would like to work with sound like animators work with visuals
  - virtual and augmented reality, particularly, where possible, in the browser and in combination with web technology
  - open web-socket technology
  - cloud and microservice technology
<br>

These do seem to be big topics though, so making them attainable and relevant in this form will likely prove tricky. I am aware there will need to be some breaking down of these into smaller component parts in order to be able to quantify them in a useful and managable way.
