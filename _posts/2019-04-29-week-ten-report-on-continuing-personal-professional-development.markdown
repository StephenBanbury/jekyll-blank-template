## Introduction

I embarked on the MA with no formal qualifications in software development. Although I am in possession of a reasonably wide-ranging experience, having built up a ‘full stack’ of internet development skills, including database development, data analysis, business intelligence, .NET MVC, C# and JavaScript, this has been gained through experience whilst working in the field of education data analysis. Of these skills, it is the front-end, client-side, user-interactive variety with which I am less familiar or confident, but they are the ones I am most interested in pursuing: I want to make web-based apps that are engaging, visual and experientially-stimulating.

My first degree is a BA in Music, with Visual Performance as a minor, and I always felt lacking in some of the rudiments of software development in comparison with my computer science graduate colleagues.  However, I also felt the urge to combine my enjoyment of coding with my appetite for creativity and an interest in on-going developments within creative technology. The MA in Creative App Development appealed as it looked like it would help me to develop creatively, beyond the limitations of my career as a developer up to this point in time.

So far, the course is providing me with a framework for thinking about the process of creative development and the industry itself, whilst challenging me to find a pathway for my own personal and professional development. The goals I have set myself combine 

1.	the need to develop specific technical skills,
2.	market research, and 
3.	studying methods for managing the process of creative development. 

Perhaps it is my background in both education data analysis and the creative industry, but I have found myself to be comfortable thinking in terms of game-focused education tools as a niche to explore. I also have a personal interest in development of Autism apps, having a son diagnosed with autism, who is home-schooled in a programme we, as a family, are heavily involved in delivering. 

I hope that this course will help me realise my ambition, which is to start a business of my own, creating intelligent, useful and innovative apps that play a small part in moving the industry forwards.

## Time and Project Management

![Time Management](\images\time-management.png)

The goal I outlined in my PCS referred to problems I have finding periods of quality, uninterrupted time, and my desire to ‘negotiate’ such periods with my family.  Reflecting on this, I am somewhat resigned to working around and within the activity and mechanics of everyday family life. My situation has made me think about how I can reduce the importance of the actual amount of time available.  I do not view project and time management as a strength and understand it would be extremely beneficial to work at this. 

Following a suggestion in [dansilvestre.com](http://www.dansilvestre.com/time-management-techniques/), I intend to create a time management ‘rule book’, which will contain a list of documented techniques that can be used on an everyday basis, in order to assist focusing on productivity whilst reducing the negative impacts of tiredness and stress. Many example strategies exist, such as the twenty-two listed in [proofhub.com](https://www.proofhub.com/articles/time-management-strategies).

I have begun using the **Pomodoro** technique, which has been shown to support better productivity and greater learning ability (see [naturalfactors](https://naturalfactors.com/en-us/articles/manage-stress-pomodoro-technique/)). I have found breaking up my working time into short sessions to be beneficial, allowing me to maintain freshness of thought.

On peer recommendation, I have obtained a copy of _Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-free Productivity_ by David Allen, which I will be studying over the next few weeks.

I will be employing the central tenets of **Agile**, in particular, methodologies related to _Scrum_; that is, working incrementally and iteratively in short, fixed-length _sprints_, allowing regular reflection and encouraging response to any lessons learned. For several years, I worked in an Agile development environment as part of a ‘self-organizing’ team ([agilealliance.org](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/)). But agile methodologies are also relevant when working as an individual ([lucidchart.com](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/what-is-agile-scrum-methodology)).

Beyond software development and general project management, Agile techniques are now also becoming recognised as a way for individuals to manage their personal lives. It may be that Agile will seamlessly inform my work-life balance entirely: – 

> Working from a prioritized product backlog, breaking work into iterations, limiting work in progress, and regular reflection are just some of the concepts borrowed from agile that people can use to better manage their personal lives.<br>

# SMART Goal: -

* **Specific:** The goal is to create a time-management rule book, which will define the rules that I will use in project management and my day-to-day life and use Agile methodologies to manage my development process.
* **Measurable:** I will find ten time-management techniques that I believe will work for me. I will place all my current goals into my Kanban board.
* **Attainable:** My ten rules will be assessed daily and kept or discarded depending on their success or failure, which I will document in my journal.
* **Relevant:** Management of my time, work and study practice are essential if I am to create a sustainable and satisfactory work-life balance. 
* **Time-based:** I will have my rule book and Kanban board fully set up by the end of Module 1.

## Market Research

![Market Research](\images\market-research.jpg)

From not having a firm idea of my direction at the start of the course, as a main driving force I am becoming interested in **education apps**, with Autism as a possible area for specialism. 

Understanding how someone with autism views and responds to the world is quite a challenge, as is teaching a child to learn what everyone else takes for granted as part of normal development and learned behaviour.  Areas that can be identified as requiring specific and targeted input, such as understanding facial expressions or developing fine motor skills, could potentially be addressed in interesting and playful ways through the medium of an app. Some interesting work has been done in these areas: for example, an app to help practice [emotion and facial recognition](https://www.educationalappstore.com/app/training-faces-1), reading facial expressions using [Google Glass](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/900519), practicing [motor skills](http://www.eastersealstech.com/2015/04/01/10-apps-for-practicing-motor-skills/).

Apps that address teaching skills to people with autism or attempt to tap into the way the world is viewed by autistic people, I feel, could potentially be highly creative, with scope for an experimental approach to interacting with and creating worlds through the use of **Virtual** and **Augmented Reality**. 

> ..people with autism are using VR to convey their own experiences, both to raise awareness of the condition and to capture the cognitive and perceptual differences that characterize it.<br>
&ndash; [spectrumnews](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/virtual-reality-transforming-autism-studies/)

Although I have a personal interest in autism, I feel it would be beneficial to understand the education app market generally. I would also like to observe and get a feel for the market for experimental and art-based apps, particularly those that explore ideas related to sensorial experience and that could open potential spaces for autistic minds to explore.

# SMART Goal: -

* **Specific:** The goal is to investigate app stores at Apple, Google and Microsoft, to research literature and other relevant media, and to create a spreadsheet comprising existing apps and developments within the areas of education, education games and autism-focused apps.
* **Measurable:** Results of my research will be stored in a spreadsheet and I will write a journal entry outlining and responding to my findings.
* **Attainable:** This information will be available via targeted searches on the internet, such as app stores, articles, forums and other media. Examples have been shown to exist.
* **Relevant:** Once I have an understanding of what apps exists and the niches they occupy, I will be able to begin formulating my own plans for entering the market myself.
* **Time-based:** I expect the research and creation of the database to take 4-5 hours and the journal entry to take another 2 hours – so a solid working day in total.

## 2D Animation

![2D Animation](\images\2d-animation.jpg)

From the outset, I was interested in user-experience and, considering my interest in game-focused, interactive education apps, I see game-oriented animation as an integral part of a skill-set necessary to create polished, professional looking and highly playable games in order to move into these markets.

I intend to use my app jam word game project, which is essentially a two-dimensional arcade-style game with an educational leaning, as a vehicle to experiment with specifically game-focused animation rendering. My work using the [pixijs.com](http://www.pixijs.com) animation library has been a useful point of entry into the use of JavaScript animation libraries, and I wish to continue the process of familiarising myself with game development, through integrating graphics rendered using a tool designed specifically for building games, and which leverage the power of **Canvas** and **WebGL** in the browser. 

I have investigated opinions expressed in online forums and by peers and read reviews and articles discussing the subject. This research has indicated [phaser.io](http://www.phaser.io) to be a suitable tool with which to begin my explorations. My hope is that the quality of the results will help realise the potential of my word game to develop into what, I believe, could be a future commercial product.

I used the **Angular** framework for the App Jam project, partly because I’d already started learning it prior to the course, but also due to its use as a basis for at least two cross-platform mobile development frameworks - **NativeScript** and **Ionic** –  both of which I am interested in investigating in the future. This required adapting the pure JavaScript of the PixiJS documentation and examples into TypeScript. I found this not to have been much of a hindrance. My goal is to add Phaser to my Angular boilerplate so as to be available, alongside PixiJs, in my future projects.

# SMART Goal: -

* **Specific:** The goal is to integrate the Phaser game framework into my Angular boilerplate and demonstrate its use within my App Jam word game.
* **Measurable:** Once integrated, to prove its suitability I will use Phaser to drive one feature of the word game’s game-play.  I will document the process in an entry in my Creative Reflective Journal.
* **Attainable:** I will devote a two-week sprint to this, immediately after I have completed all course work and journal entries for the current module.
* **Relevant:** I will add Phaser to my Angular boilerplate and prove it to work in tandem with PixiJS.
* **Time-based:** I will begin a two-week sprint devoted to this goal once I have completed the current module’s course work and journal entries.

## WebSockets and Cloud Technologies

![WebSockets](\images\websockets.png)

Having grown up with computers existing largely as separate entities and then the promise of the internet frustrated by the laborious request/response paradigm of HTTP, I was excited when I first became aware of the prospect of almost instantaneous interactions between people, computers and software. 

For some time, I’ve been considering how I could make use of **WebSockets**. Most of my initial ideas fell roughly into the domain of social media. However, in relation to the kind of education apps I am now considering, a powerful feature would be for real-time interactions and collaborations between students, teachers, classmates and parents etc.  Alongside full duplex connectivity, I would like to make the most of advancements within cloud technologies, such as flexible online storage and serverless functions (for example Amazon AWS and Firebase). In terms of my word game app, the use of these could include the following: -

1.	Drawing on saved states from previous sessions
2.	Mapping progress over time
3.	Setting up scenarios and challenges in advance of the next session
4.	Flexibility of location, platform or device
5.	Common processes undertaken by microservices hosted in the cloud

In this regard, I envisage my planned education game apps taking on some of the technical aspects used in **multi-player games**. I would like to undertake a feasibility study and devise a plan for turning my App Jam word-game into a multi-player game. The plan would use WebSockets to facilitate communication between players, cloud-based storage to maintain game state and record achievement, and serverless functions to manage aspects of game-play such as ‘dealing’ words to the players. I believe these technologies are freely available and, individually, not too difficult to master.

# SMART Goal: -

* **Specific:** The goal is to create a concept and technical ‘blueprint’ of the structure of my App Jam word-game realised as a multi-player game
* **Measurable:** The document will comprise diagrams, charts and explanations that sets out the entire model.
* **Attainable:** I want to create this over one week. 
* **Relevant:** The blueprint will be such that it will enable me to make an immediate start on modifying the existing app and implementing new features.
* **Time-based:** I want to use three sessions on successive days - the first for research of technologies, the second to develop my findings and to draw up a prototype, and the third to finalise the concept as a complete blueprint.

<br><br>
## Music and Sound

![Music and Sound](\images\computer-music.jpg)

It seems to me that the part played by sound in media experiences is often under-valued. As a musician and creator of music and sound art, I would like to see sound placed on an equal footing with visual aspects. At some point I would like to make creative apps where sound is the main driving force. Such apps could be in the form of sound-led **experimental art apps**, such as _Bjork’s Biophilia_ or _synthPond_ by _Zach Gage_, or **music education** and **music-game** apps, such as _Dust Buster app for Piano_ or music puzzle games like _Tapt_.

I have extensive experience of creating music, both acoustically and electronically and, having also flirted with being a visual artist, I am particularly interested in the **cross-overs** that can flourish between sonic and other creative activities, as demonstrated in my BA degree in Music, in which I minored in Visual Performance, and having since worked collaboratively in the production of multi-disciplinary installation, contemporary dance, film and theatre.  

Recently, music has played less of a dominant role as a creative activity. Whereas I once co-ran a DIY electronica music label and was continually producing and performing, I think I would now struggle to create and output at a similar level of intensity and my confidence in my ability to do so has consequently dipped. However, I am not downhearted about this, as software development has in large part taken over.  I now intend to phase in, over the course of my development, the use of sound in increasingly interesting and creative ways. 

* playback of recorded and sampled sound
* attachment of sound to events, such as those driven by user interaction 
* streaming sound across an internet connection 
* sound creation - via synthesis
* sound manipulation - effects etc.

But, more immediately, I would like to concentrate on adding sound to my App Jam word game in order to make it a more “immersive and emotionally-charged experience” (see [amplifon.ie]( http://www.amplifon.ie/resources/playing-with-your-mind/)).

# SMART Goal: -

* **Specific:** The goal is to add basic sound to my word game project. 
* **Measurable:** I need sounds for the following events: collisions (both positive and negative), game over, level completed and background soundtrack. The goal will be complete once I have these basic sounds satisfactorily in place.
* **Attainable:** I am competent in creating sounds and music as well as having access to online sound effects libraries. I will use online resources to study how to add sound to events in JavaScript and as a continual soundtrack.
* **Relevant:** The game requires these sounds in place to improve the overall quality, playability and to enhance the user-experience.
* **Time-based:** I will use three sessions on consecutive days: the first to creating my app jam sound library, the second for research and learning  and the third for implementation.

## Conclusion

One of the most useful things I have learned has been the importance of constantly reacting to my achievements and failures and assessing what I have learned from them.  This has led me to continually re-appraise the goals I have set myself and helped me move forward in terms of my ideas, expectations and ambitions.  As a result, rather than tie my goals down to their initial incarnations, I have allowed them to evolve naturally so that they can better suit what I have learned since they were first put onto paper. 

Through reflection, I have also found that game-focused education apps and, specifically, autism related apps have become interesting to me. In particular due to my personal interests due to having an autistic son.

I feel confident that continuing to take this approach will ultimately lead me to success in my chosen fields.
