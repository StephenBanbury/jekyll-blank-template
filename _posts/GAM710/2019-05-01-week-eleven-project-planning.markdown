title: Week Eleven - How Do We Plan and Manage Larger Creative App Development Projects?
published: true

This week we look at the two main methods used for managing large creative development projects: the age-old _Waterfall_ model and the more modern _Scrum_ methodology, which is one of a number of approaches that sit under the umbrella philosophy, _Agile_.

As a term, the _Waterfall_ methodology is something I’ve only recently come across, although it describes the way things were generally done from at least the 1970s ([_‘waterfall model’_, wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)). Things began to change after the authoring, in 2001, of the Agile Manifesto ([_'what is agile?'_, agile alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/)). 

## Personal experience

# Waterfall

My earliest development projects were extremely loose in their definition – I was the sole developer and did not really embrace any particular methodology; in many respects, I was really just _making it up_ as I went along. However, the way I worked was probably closer to the Waterfall model than an Agile one as, in extremely simplified terms, I would agree with my client an initial and reasonably coherent idea of how we envisaged the end result and I would go away and build it. When the product was ready it would be presented to the client, it would be accepted, my invoice would be honoured, and that was pretty much the end of the matter. Admittedly, it wasn't quite as simple as that and there would have been plenty of dialogue and contact with the client during the development process, as well as bugs to iron out after deployment, but it was essentially a process that followed a direct linear route from initial planning to finished product.

However, one of my projects - a subscriptions management system for a religious magazine - encountered a problem - one that I imagine could typically be associated with the Waterfall approach but should never happen under an Agile model: the product was taking longer than had initially been estimated and the budget had long since been used up! Either I starved, defaulted on my extortionate London-size rent, or I would have to approach my client and ask for more money so as to produce a finished product. I chose that latter option. 

I had agreed a budget with my client, a company director, which had been approved by the board. But he now had to re-approach the board, cap in hand, asking for more money to be released. I distinctly remember the embarrassment of having to admit we’d - _I'd_ - made a mistake and that the only way round this was for me to either finish the project by working on the latter stages for free, or for us to agree a way forward that involved some re-working of the budget on the part of the client. Issues of trust and reputation were at stake.

# Scrum

A _scrum_ methodology would have avoided this extremely awkward situation because we would have continually been assessing and re-evaluating progress, addressing issues as the product developed, iteratively, over a sequence of manageable sprints. It may still have been the case that we had got the initial estimated budget wrong, and this would have remained an issue that needed dealing with, but it would have been highly unlikely that we would have arrived at a point where a bombshell had to be dropped and the only two possible resolutions were almost unpalatable, either to the developer or the client. Instead, under an agile approach, decisions could have been made either to reflect the changing situation with amendments and actions at the sprint-planning stage, or revisions to budgets and management of expectations could have been controlled more easily, sensitively and democratically. 

As it was, the board agreed an extension and an increased budget, but I was still left knowing that I never want to find myself in this position again. 

Years later, when working as part of an Agile team using the scrum methodology, I saw at first-hand how a project can be developed from an initial plan and realised as a released product, over any number of continual iterations, via a process that allows unexpected hitches and changes of client requirements to be dealt with as they arise. Rather than being subject to updated requirements at the _end_ of the project's development lifecycle, and potentially being adversely affected by changes to, as in this case for example, the pre-determined budget set for a monolithic end product, individual sprints facilitate the ability to react to events and situations as they arise, and projects can be designed in such a way as to allow any potential blows to be greatly lessened or removed entirely.

## Planning an Agile Project Using Scrum

As outlined above, being aware of the benefits of Agile and the pitfalls of a non-agile approach, I am keen to embrace this approach, in particular _scrum_, as a model for planning my projects. I will create a SMART goal to begin planning the continuing progress of my App Jam word-game project using scrum as the template for defining a Product Backlog and the first Sprint Backlog. This will form the basis from which the project will continue as I move forward.

* **Make it Specific:** So that I can continue to work on its development in a flexible, iterative way in line with Agile practice and ideology, my goal is to set up my App Jam word game project using the Scrum methodology.
* **Make it Measurable:** I will create Product Backlog items (as User Stories) for the work I know I need to get done and set up my first sprint in a ready-to-go state.
* **Make it Attainable:** This will be achieved within a single sprint planning session.
* **Make it Relevant:** I will be able to make an immediate start on continuing my project work as soon as I am able to do so. 
* **Make it Time-Based:** I will allow a maximum of three hours for the sprint planning session.

## Summary

I have used my experience of working under a model similar to a _Waterfall_ methodology in order to contrast it with my experience of working in an _Agile Scrum_ environment. In so doing, I have shown how the kind of problems I experienced, that are associated with the older model, should not be possible under the more modern Agile approach. I've then created a SMART goal to define the development of my App Jam word game project using Scrum methodologies. When I am in a position to do so, I will use this plan as I move forward with my project.
