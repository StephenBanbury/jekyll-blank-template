## In The Beginning

When I started the MA, I had been working for a decade with databases and data analysis, and for the following six years on a web-based database-connected application, using the Microsoft .NET MVC platform with HTML and JavaScript for the front-end. I held the assumption that I’d naturally continue down the path of web-based development, but I also wanted to explore the creative possibilities of mobile development. Anything beyond this was a little vague. However, the one thing I was certain about was that I’d like to start working to a much greater extent with the user-facing, interactive side of app development (this excites me far more than working further back in the stack with databases and business intelligence) making apps that are useful, interesting, look good, sound good and importantly, are fun to use. I also started out with a desire to explore the potential of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Virtual and Augmented Reality.   

## Games and Learning

One thing I did not expect to become involved with is games. However, it did not take long, after starting the course, to find myself considering education-focused games as a possible avenue to explore. My App Jam project, an education-focused arcade-style game, started me thinking about the value of games in a wider context than I had previously, particularly as a means of drawing in the user and holding their attention in order to facilitate learning via a fun activity and playful environment. For me, this idea was confirmed and developed in week eight's course material - [**_What is Creativity?_**]({% link _posts/2019-04-18-week-eight-what-is-creativity.markdown %}) - where it was noted that

>games are not purely about entertainment, but can also be powerful tools for learning

# The potential for VR in education games

The course material for week five - [**_Types of App_**]({% link _posts/2019-03-14-week-five-types-of-app.markdown %}) - had allowed me to begin finding a context for these ideas and to start thinking about existing markets, such as those for _Gamification_ and _Serious Games_. The latter had started to draw me into thinking about the immersive nature and educational potential of _Virtual Reality_ - for instance, its ability to place its audience within an environment created such that they would be empowered to experience something close to the reality of a particular place, situation or event from history. An example is the [**_BBC 1943 Berlin Blitz_**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zk3cmfr) virtual reality experience, in which the audience is taken in a Lancaster bomber on a blitz raid over Berlin during the Second World War.

This piece is particularly powerful because it is a recreation of a real-life event based on the voice-recorded narrative of a contemporary WW2 journalist, [Wynford Vaughan-Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynford_Vaughan-Thomas), who risked his own life (and that of his recording engineer) in order to accompany the mission. I accidentally and fortuitously encountered a BBC television documentary - unfortunately I have not since been able to find a copy or any documentation of it - where the Berlin Blitz experience was tried out by a group of school pupils - it was notable how the learning process was found to be more intense and more valuable to the pupils when history was experienced as if they had been actual participants, rather than reading about disconnected facts in a text book. 

## Virtual Reality and Autism Spectrum Disorder 

Thinking further about VR, I came to consider its potential to create an environment that can be comfortably explored by autistic people. I should explain at this point that my younger son, who is now eight years old, was provided with an early diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as a toddler. His mother and I have spent a significant amount of time concerning ourselves with his education and development and have put together a predominantly home-schooled programme based on [Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis): -

>a scientific discipline concerned with applying techniques based upon the principles of learning to change behaviour of social significance.

I think there is a lot of potential with autism and VR. Autism is very much about difficulties of socialisation and how one relates to the world and communicates with other people. This can be a very difficult thing for autistic people to deal with. The world that most of us take for granted, in which we spend a large proportion of our lives socialising and interacting with others, can often cause confusion, intense anxiety and feelings of isolation for autistic people. If it is possible for Virtual Reality to create environments in which people with autism feel comfortable and are able to communicate with others whilst circumventing problems associated with an inability to read and understand the subtleties of expression and social interaction, then VR could be an extremely useful and potentially important tool. 

My week nine journal entry on [**_emerging technology_**]({% link _posts/2019-04-19-week-nine-emerging-tech.markdown %}) shows some of the research I have begun in this area. I came across practitioners in the field of autism research who appear to be quite excited about the possibilities of VR and are thinking about it in a similar way to me. Most appear to be academics within the field of autistic research, rather than working within software development or technology. I've read of people doing research into the use of VR in autism and finding very little, and at the time I found very little myself. I recognised that I needed to do more thorough research into this, but I believed there to be a potential market for the use of VR and AR in autism.

# A market emerges

Since then, I have come across a company in the United States - [Floreo](https://floreotech.com/) - who have created a VR product that 

> is based on established social and communication techniques intended to help individuals with ASD build real world skills. Specifically, we are developing content for learning discrete social behaviors, managing planned and unplanned events, and improving sensory and emotional regulation.

So it does, after all, appear that a market has opened up for VR and ASD. That said, I intend to continue to research this area as it is clearly in its infancy and there could be scope for plenty more research. ASD is [not a straight-forward condition to define](https://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is.aspx?gclid=Cj0KCQjwtr_mBRDeARIsALfBZA5u4OYairNw0bC7U8shJ6QqZbkosfAnPRfVHgz3LcZRpr2AexDurpwaArFAEALw_wcB); it encompasses widely varying levels of 'functional' abilities - for example cognitive, physical, social, spatial etc - as well as many [related conditions](https://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is/related-conditions.aspx) such as _Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)_, _Dyslexia_ and _Dyspraxia_.

# Furthering the opportunities for research into virtual reality and autism (the Falmouth _Creative App Development MA_ community steps in)

As if to demonstrate the importance to the lone creative app developer of _community_, as discussed in week ten - [**_who else is making apps?_**]({% link _posts/2019-04-30-week-ten-who-else-is-making-apps.markdown %}), my peers offered some food for thought and some useful advice.

Dr Jamie White enquired as to whether I would consider doing a PHD in order to do further research in the field. My answer is that, whilst it is not something I have seriously considered up to now, it does have an appeal. A major concern would be how it would be funded but, if I am able to do so satisfactorily, it could be something that I would give full due consideration. I was suggested by one of my peers that, in the meantime, if I were able to identify a market and start producing products that I am capable of creating now, I could focus on that market, getting to know it intimately whilst supplying and developing it.

This is now something I am thinking about. Potentially, I could begin planning now and start putting out small-scale apps into the existing autism apps market. Over time this market would become one that I get to know and understand and whose needs I could attempt to satisfy. If virtual reality really does have a future in the field of autism, I would be in a strong position to find out and formulate a plan to enter into it, maybe even to play a part in its creation.

As part of my interest in Virtual Reality, I intend exploring its potential as a web-based technology. I understand this is some way off being a common and well-supported platform for VR - [**WebVR**](https://webvr.info/) is currently not available on all browsers and mobile device screens do not yet have the framerates or high resolution associated with more powerful platforms. But, as an emerging technology, it's something I believe is worth following. The power of the web is partly its ability to democratise technology and make it available to more people - something that could seriously help VR find a place within autism therapy and research.

## Summary

In the twelve weeks of my MA journey so far, with sincerity I feel able to say I have 'travelled a long way'. The course lectures, interviews and the subjects they have introduced have provided information and context for me to reflect on and to develop my ideas. Material provided in order to inform and encourage the consideration of commercial aspects, potential markets, the types of app that exist in these markets, and audience development, has been very interesting. I have begun to gain a much more developed sense of the kind of work being done in different areas of app development, such as with emerging technologies, and have thoroughly enjoyed discussing creative practice, management of the creative process and the concept of creativity itself. 

I suppose the most pertinent aspect of my journey so far has been that I have begun forming an idea of potential pathways for myself. I have identified education gaming as an interesting way of enhancing the learning process with fun and creativity and found the prospect of using VR and AR in educational games and experience to be thought provoking. In particular, I have identified the use of VR in the field of ASD research and therapy as an exciting and personally-interesting area for possible further research, with a view to entering the market and maybe playing a role in its development.
