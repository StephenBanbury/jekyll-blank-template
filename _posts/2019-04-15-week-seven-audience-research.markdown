title: Week Seven - Audience Research
published: true
---

This week's subject is one that is frustratingly important; 'frustratingly', because this is a subject that describes an activity that is close to being absolutely essential whilst, at the same time, a prospect that I do not find to be particularly stimulating. Of course, I recognise the importance of attempting to understand the people that I would like to use my apps and, in so doing, help finance the future of my business. But, to be brutally honest, it is an activity that I would hope could be done by someone for whom marketing is a passion and a talent. I realise that, in all likelihood, I will need to involve myself in audience research at some level if I am to be successful as a creative app developer.

That said, I do recognise that Audience Research could potentially be a rewarding experience; getting to know my audience could perhaps lead to a sense of fulfilment and, at best, instil a sense of commonality and shared experience. Of course, the ultimate reward would probably be in witnessing the success of my creation, the people using it having been identified, understood, nurtured and encouraged to invest in my work because it is something they desire, enjoy or simply need.

I also recognise the importance of audience research, both in terms of employing marketing and sales methods that suit the particular characteristics that make up the intended audience, but also the potential to tailor the app itself, or aspects of the app, to suit its potential audience. Discovering too late that the targeted audience is actually incompatible with what had been expected in the earlier stages of development or after the marketing budget has been spent, could be disastrous for the business.

One aspect of Audience Research that I could potentially find to be stimulating is something I have experience in, i.e. the analysis of the data - transcribing the results, getting a feel for the data and what it 'means', and then reporting on the findings. However, this, along with the design of the research project and the physical act of gathering the data itself, looks to be an extremely labour-intensive activity and something that, from my perspective, as someone who is excited by creative and technical development, but for whom the concept of Audience Research is of less interest, I imagine to be less daunting and onerous if it were shared amongst a team, no matter how small.

## Methods of Audience Research
During this week's video, **Erik Geelhoed**, who has a background in _Psychology and Experimental Statistics_ and has built up an impressive and diverse experience in academia and within the industry, outlines the main methodologies involved in Audience Research, starting with a discussion of why it is a necessary activity. All this seems admirably logical and simple in its reasoning: -

1. your audience is your key to success
2. the larger the audience you can engage, the greater the chance of success
3. in order to be successful, one's product must be exciting
4. what is exciting is different to different people
5. therefore, in order to engage and excite your audience, it is necessary to understand the diversity and the characteristics of your audience

As we are working within an international market place, and cannot meet our audience in person, investigating one's audience is a challenge, but there are a number of tools and techniques available to us for this purpose. Two important, complimentary approaches are: -

# 1. Qualitative methods
* Cognitive walkthrough / thinking aloud - asking the user to use the app and think aloud
* Interview - asking the right questions
* Group interview - researcher-led
* Focus group
* Participants keeping a diary
* Observations - the 'whats' and 'whys'
* Self-reflections of the researcher (i.e. yourself)

# 2. Quantitative methods
* Obtaining numbers, statistics, for analysis
* Questionnaires
* Physiological measurements - e.g. levels of attention (EEG: electroencephalogram - a test used to evaluate the electrical activity in the brain), sweat secretion (GSR: galvanic skin response - a change in the electrical resistance of the skin that is a physiochemical response to emotional arousal which increases sympathetic nervous system activity)
* Technology logs – when started, stopped, which buttons pressed, etc.
* Observations – when and how long, how often
* Psycho-physical testing – hearing, seeing, tasting, feeling, smelling etc.	

# Advice on qualitative analysis 

It is qualitative analysis that most likely will be used used - this is not necessarily so different from quantitative methods. 
* During the **interviewing** process (often called in-depth interview), be yourself. The interview is only as good as your questions, so know what you want to find out. Chose subjects who are representative of your target population. Maybe ask friends or family if they are in some small way representative. Make sure both parties sign a consent form.
* **Analysis** is time demanding and time consuming. Do the transcription of the data collected yourself, getting a good feel for the data. Mark the interviews with comments, classify them, categorise them, then write a report. Transcribing should preferably be verbatim (incl. ‘eh’, ‘aaahh’ etc). Maybe use an audio editor and repeatedly loop short sections. The questions themselves **are** the categories for analysis, but you can add more. Write up the analysis and use quotes as illustration.

## Creating a 'persona' for the App Jam word game

My App Jam project - an arcade-style word game - is something that I view as having educational value in the sense that it could potentially be helpful in sharpening the ability to understand the meaning of words and their meaningful relationships with other words.
In order to better understand my potential audience for this app, it would be an interesting exercise to create a 'persona', i.e. _a fictional character that represents a user of the application_, that would represent my target audience. I have created a SMART goal to support this: -
* **Make it Specific:** The goal is to create a fictional persona, who will represent a typical user of my App Jam word game app. 
* **Make it Measurable:** I will create one persona and post the results on the Personas forum on Canvas.
* **Make it Attainable:** I will learn about creating personas by following the Pluralsight course [Creating Effective User Stories](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/creating-effective-user-stories/table-of-contents), with particular attention to the _Personas_ section.
* **Make it Relevant:** The research and the resulting persona will help my understand a potential typical user of my app and, therefore, some of the characteristics of the audience I intend to target.
* **Make it Time-Based:** I will create this persona in a single session of approximately two hours.

## Summary

I have discussed how important Audience Research is to the success of an app, in terms of understanding the characteristics of its potential audience in order to inform marketing strategies, tailoring the app and avoiding costly mistakes. 

I have recognised that my lack of enthusiasm for the process, partly due to my interests being in other aspects of the creative process and because of the time and resources that need to be applied to the activity, can be partially offset not only by its importance to the app's success, but the prospect of there being potentially rewarding aspects in terms of personal satisfaction. 

I have summarised the main points from Erik Geelhoed's lecture on Audience Research. 

I have then created a SMART goal in order to form an image of the kind of potential audience 'persona' that may exist for my App Jam word game.
