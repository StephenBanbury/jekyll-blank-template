## Scrum Envisioning / Product Planning

* **Thorough research**
    * Reducing the brief down into the most crucial elements
    * Key phrases
    * Identify similar products on the market
    * Collate as much information as possible to inform ideation
    * The ideation stage should then begin to formulate the essence of an idea that has the potential to develop into a product

* **Envisioning** 
    * Formalise what you have so far into a document outlining the higher level product
    * Use this document as a form of proposal or agreement of the work to be carried out for the client
    * Also used in scrum as a planning document to intiate product development

* **Product charter**
    * Created through completion of the envisioning process
    * Will become the foundation for your proposal 




## Struggling with a decision

I'm struggling to make a decision, one that needs to be made very soon, as to which brief - [**NHS Trust Sowenna Sensory Room**](https://sowenna.cornwallft.nhs.uk/) or [**Shelter Box Conference Booth Games**](https://www.shelterbox.org/) - to take on. 

The **Shelter Box** project is more loosely defined. Our initial conversation was interesting and the enthusiasm for the project was palpable, but there was little put forward in terms of vaguely firm ideas for what form the 'conference booth games' would take. This could be a positive or a negative thing, depending on how it is viewed.

The **Sowenna** project is likely to be based around the idea of a beach environment. The young people invovled in the CAMHS project have put forward what they would like - one, or maybe two, have been completed or are close to completion, whilst the one remaining is the beach environment. It's easy to start envisioning a product armed with this information.

**Shelter Box** have not stipulated any specific equiment must be used. They seem open to exploring my own suggestions, which would probably be for the Oculus Quest, seeing as 
1. I have purchased one and this is what I would like to use 
2. it is relatively inexpensive as no powerful computer is required and 
3. it is untethered and therefore not limited to specific spacial requirements in the same way as 'standard' headsets.

**Sowenna** project stipulates what equiment is to be used. I do not yet know if I would be provided with their equiment to use for development as the main project lead has not yet been available to discuss this. But if I were not provided with this then development would be more difficult and if equipment were provided then I'd need to spend more time learning a different development path on an unfamiliar platform and technical setup.

Both projects could potentially continue after this initial stage. In the case of the Sowenna project this could include the possibility of the research side of things. Maybe this could be something I could involve myself in regardless of whether or not I take on this particular brief. I sense from the Shelter Box project that this could be just the start. Potentially, I could involve myself in futher development of these ideas and help take them forward into different virual and real-life locations, such as going 'on tour' in festivals and exhibitions.


## Initial thoughts on ideation

**Sowenna**

Lying on a beach is generally a calming experience. It's easy to understand why it was chosen by the young people as one of their prefered ideas for a VR sensory environment. Using this as a starting point for developing ideas, I can envisage lying down watching clouds rolling by, birds flying overhead, birds soaring or holding their position against the breeze. A sun lamp could be used to to provide real heat to suplement the virtual sun; an electric fan could provide the breeze. Turning your head towards the horizon would bring the pulsating sea into view, with waves hitting and breaking on the shore. Drift wood would undulate on its surface. The mesmerizing, repetitive sound of the rolling waves would be relaxing and sleep-inducing.

**Shelter Box**

As a starting point, I can imagine a kind of game, where the 'player' is in a disaster control centre awaiting incoming reports of different kinds of disasters, as they happen. It would be necessary to quickly grab, from shelves and hooks, the equipment that would be required for the particular disaster - be it a hurricane causing villages to be destroyed, floods destroying crops and causing potential food shortages, or conflict causing mass displacement of people - and to put this equipment in a blue Shelter Box. The time scale for this would be unrealistic, but designed to put the player under pressure and add to the sense of jeopardy. There could be a budget to which the player would need to stay within, which would be used up by the resources being placed into the box. The budget could be periodically refreshed by the addition of funds via charitable support - perhaps this could be in the form of game-style 'power-ups', or via the requirement to periodically instigate a public information event to replenish funds.
