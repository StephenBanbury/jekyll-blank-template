There has been lots and lots of experimentation with movement. Building a teleporation system. How to get it to work in a way that is usable and intuative. Is it required at all? Can we combine it with joystick movement? Should we use joystick alone? If so, should we reduce the size of the world? Can we stop orientation making it extra confusing - would like to just have head pointing the same way no matter where it is oriented before, during or after teleportation. 

One can spend too long on these issues. Even though it is clearly sometimes better to put it aside for now and come back to it later, to allow faster prototyping, it is often difficult to let go! A discipline that needs working on.

*Focusing* on specific areas - set goals that are targeted and clearly defined. I've discovered the importance of this. This is where sprint becomes important, and using the kanban board efficiently and precisely.

My client is happy to see what I come up with. But because of this I need to be clearer and more targeted in my approach - it's up to me to be this way. If not, if too loose and open to meandering, how does one assess one's direction of travel? Goals need to be set in order to know how to gaugue progress and ensure you are on track. They also mean that the client is able to come on the journey with you and see where it all is leading. It provides them the oportunity to make suggestions and requrests from an informed position, rather than just seeing where you end up and then, maybe too late, making judgement calls on the results.
