Leon Brown - a few different business models for the creative app developer:

* Software Development as a Service (SDaaS)
* Software as a Product (SaaP)
* Software as a Service (SaaS)

SDaaS - monetisation of your skills, trading your time for developing software. 
Low risk. Minimal cost. Flexible (your time, you decide).
Precarious. No guarantees. Low profic margins. Competition - always someone who will do it cheaper.

SaaP - developer builds the product and reaps the rewards. Create a team of experts - product managers, graphic designers, front/back-end developers, marketers etc..
Control of vision. Freedom, flexibility, potential for profit.
Cost - heavier seeding financially. Time waiting for a return. Risk. Failure = debt.

SaaS - monetise the output of software rather than the software itself, through monthly subscriptions or yearly payments etc.
Pros and cons similar to SaaP, plus :
Pros - the potential for more diverse income streams, responding to feedback, continuous income
Cons - upkeep costs, duty of care to users - boring details such as payment methods, data storage, authentication.

# What will be my preferred business model?

Well, I've been building software for a while now and it is my day-job. I don't really see myself continuing in this vein for much longer. Being a 'code-monkey' (any perceived slighting of the trade is not indentional) and continuualy learning new languages, platforms, techniques etc. whilst constantly striving to be close to the top of your profession, is certainly an interesting and stimulating activity. But as a be all and end all, I feel I would not / do not gain the pure satisfaction from this career as I once would have / did. To earn as much as I feel I need to as I and my young family gets older would add to this particular pressure. So, SDaaS is not my future. 

Saap and SaaS are more interesting to me. Both have attractions. I think it depends on the type of product envisaged as much as what kind of model you would prefer to follow. It seems many products that would once have been part of the SaaP domain have moved into the SaaS domain. So there is some burring here. Perhaps SaaS is gaining a greater share of the market for a good reason. It is probably the way to go.



## First prototype

**End of Sprint 1**

The past two weeks I have been rapidly building my first prototype. I am fairly close to a MVP, one which I will be happy to show to my client for the purpose of discussion and feedback in order to progress to another level.

The prototype has so far been built upon the original idea, which came from early discussions with my client; that is, from what I have understood of their requirements, loose and free though they are. This freedom has, in fact, been excellent for this process, allowing my imagination the space to explore with the almost certain knowledge that what I come up with will be seriously considered as a foundation for building something more rounded, solid, developed. I really am very much looking forward to showing my progress thus far.
