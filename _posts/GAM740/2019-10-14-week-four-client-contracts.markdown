## Client Contracts

Having had little experience of this, the course material provides useful guidance for how to go about it.

Learning Outcomes:

LO1 - Explain why it is important to use client contracts.
LO2 - Describe the structure of a client contract.
LO3 - Develop a client contract appropriate to your own practice.

Useful resources include
* [The Freelancers Union](https://www.freelancersunion.org)
* [The Freelancer's Bible](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/076116488X/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&psc=1)
* [Clients from Hell](https://clientsfromhell.net)

In an article for shopify, [Ryan Foster explains](https://www.shopify.co.uk/partners/guides/grow-vol-1/how-to-write-a-contract):
>“Keeping the contract short, focused and easy to understand helps reduce friction,
>allowing you to start the project quicker (and get your deposit invoice paid sooner!).
>Without a contract, your client may not clearly understand what they are paying for.”

* Helps avoid Feature Creep and other misunderstandings.
* Defence mechanism

* Who owns the work?
* Avoid changes that are unreasonable halfway through project
* Prices and hours need to be sorted at the start

* A larger reputable company may have their own contract/agreement they want you to sign. If this is the case consider using this document as your own agreement
* Provide your own agreement to smaller clients
* If you are unsure they will pay, ask for an upfront deposit (make sure it it mentioned in the signed document)
* Some advisors would suggest *always* asking for an upfront deposit, no matter who the client is, unless you feel it is an important and valuable client and it may jeopordise getting the work.

* Be careful what you sign
* Get an independent third party to check it if you are unsure

>It is easy to let your enthusiasm for the client and the brief get the best of you but keeping
your feet on the ground and taking your time to dot the i's and cross the t's will insure that
both your and the client’s expectations align and there will be no major misunderstanding
further down the line.

# Example structure

* The company details (for both parties)
* A statement of intent (could be subject to change over the course of the project)
* Scope and deliverables
    The details of what is going to be developed. This is a chance for you to constrain the project
    and avoid feature creep. Concentrate on specifying the finer details such as:
    * What platforms will be targeted?
    * How much content will be produced?
    * What formats will be used?
    * What performance benchmarks will be set?
    * What is the process of review?
* Revisions and Alterations
     * important that you protect yourself from a never ending cycle of alterations
     * maybe specify the maximum allowance of alterations
     * opportunity to apply a fee once the maximum has been passed
     * gives the client the freedom to make changes beyond the scope of the original contract but they will do it at a cost and not for free
* Deadlines & Approvals
    * when should the work be completed and are there any consequences to missing deadlines?
    * how the work will be broken down and what criteria will it be measured against for completion
    * Who is the point of contact for agreeing the completion at each point in the development process (named in the contract)?
* Financial Matters
    * How much will the work cost?
    * Are you charging by the hour or costing for the whole job?
    * Always ask for a deposit, usually 10 - 30%.
* Termination
    * Sometimes things go wrong
    * allows you set the terms for termination that are balanced
    * is shared but you do not end up fully out of pocket.
* IP
    * important that the contract stipulates who owns the work before and after the project is complete
* Signatures
    * making the contract binding

*Templates* are good for getting started but It is important that you invest time
creating a contract that is unique to your business needs

If you are concerned that your contract is not appropriate to your needs then always get a second opinion from a
professional.
