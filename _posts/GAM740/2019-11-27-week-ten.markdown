Week 10 -Finishing the main phase - happy with holding the prototype where it is.
Agreed with client.

To spend the majority of the remaining time experimenting with other ideas.

Want to experiment with force / forces
looked at Unity Terrain, but it seems this is a bit of a 'fabrication' - wind zones make grass and trees sway, but this it not quite what I'm interested in. I want to create a 'real' force on objects caused and affected by 'wind' force. I want it to make trees and cars fly through the air, waves crash on the coastline and walls to fall down.

Maybe [Unity3d Creating Rigidbody Wind Zones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCMhrKOuBZg) will help.
