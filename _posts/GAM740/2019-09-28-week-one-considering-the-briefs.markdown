## Chosing a brief

There are three potential briefs provided by the University that I am considering: -

1. Shelter Box: Conference Booth Games
2. NHS Foundation Trust: Sowenna Sensory VR Environment
3. Tretherras School: Animal Farm KS4 Revision Guide

I also am considering putting together my own brief along with an identified client. More details of which I outline below.

I have decided that I will be using this module to develop skills in the area of Virtual Reality.
Over the course of the previous two modules I have come to the realisation that there are a number of areas of _App Development_ that I find interesting. Settling on one, or if more than one, a focused way of incorporating a small number, continues to be a challenge. However, it is **Augmented/Mixed Reality** and **Virtual Reality** that demandes my attention more than any other. As highlighted in my final post of **GAM710** - [**_What Next?_**]({% link _posts/GAM710/2019-05-04-week-twelve-1-what-next.markdown %}), I have become fascinated in the potential for both **gamification** and VR/AR to enhance the process of learning. I have also identified Autism as a condition whose needs, in terms of therapy and learning, could be explored through VR/AR. 

To this end I have purchased a VR headset - an Oculus Quest - and have begun studying and following tutorials in VR and the use of Unity to build 3-dimensional. I am keeping an open mind as to whether Unity or WebVR / WebXR is the most suitable way forward, but Untiy seems to be a good way in for me at this juncture, as it is the most intuative way to learn about something in which I currently have little to no experience. 

## Shelter Box: Conference Booth Games

>We go to the ends of the earth to reach the most remote communities that have been devastated by disaster. Our highly trained ShelterBox response teams then go the extra mile to find the people left most vulnerable after a disaster

>The aims of this brief is to generate ideas for technological solutions that can be deployed at public events to highlight the important work we do and generate discussions that raise public awareness

>The challenge is to find a balance between entertainment and serious, thought provoking engagement. How can we create playful and challenging experiences that also convey a message and urgency for our cause?

The oportunity to involve myself in a project where VR can be the driving technology is exciting. Shelter Box's brief specifically states they are interested in VR 

>There is no expectation in terms of equipment, but ShelterBox are interested in experimenting with immersive experiences such as AR, VR and mixed reality

and the idea of exploring a game-style, or game influenced solution in order to inform and educate the public of their work, interests me greatly. 

## NHS Foundation Trust: Sowenna Sensory VR Environment

>Young people ... will be offered a choice of guided mindfulness exercises with a member of staff or the use of the VR sensory environment as part of their treatment. They will be able to touch, feel, walk around or even lie down during their five minute long experience

There are some apparently specific requirements in terms of technical setup, hardware and sofware, but it's not clear if these are set in stone or simply being made available should they be required.

This brief has clear alignments with my ideas for ASD, but I will need to make enquiries to establish requirements in more depth and for more specific details. 

## Tretherras School: Animal Farm KS4 Revision Guide

>Gamification of study materials ... students require the ability to memorise the functions of key characters; recite quotations off by heart; remember Orwellâ€™s purpose for writing ... need a facility that enables them to do low stakes quizzing to test their knowledge

>The aim of this brief is to generate a technological solution that would enable students to test their knowledge on these aspects of the novel.

>We currently have struggles to motivate primarily middle ability boys. How can we use technology to help them focus and develop their knowledge and memory skills?

>The challenge is to find a balance between fun, engaging and educational.

No mention specifically of VR/AR so I would need enquire about this. But the idea of gamification of an educational objective is interesting, finding a way to engage students who are struggling with traditional methods.


All three look interesting and to have their own points of interest. I intend writing to each of their points of contact in order to obtain further information before making a decision whether or not to offer my services to one of them.

## Creating my own brief

Having discussed with my module tutor, Dr Jamie White, the potential for devising my own brief in conjunction with a potential client, I am also exploring this possibility. This way would allow me to create a brief allowing me to more specifically identify and target a combination of subject matter I am interested in with skills I wish to develop. 

Current thoughts on this are that I have an eight-year-old autistic son and a wife who works for the NHS. There is here, then, the possibility to develop a brief to create a VR app targeting an educational or theraputic need within the realm of autism. This option is becoming very attractive!
