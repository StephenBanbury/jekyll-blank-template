Enjoyed putting together a disaster zone!
Adding force of a value and in a direction (Vector3) when rigidbody enters 'wind zone'.

Added HUD display

Made this scene the first - witness the force, then back to base to do something about it.

Testing: -

Roshan - 11 year old has no problem with the mechanics.
Kirti - 47 year old non-gamer has some issues.

1. How to use the controllers
2. What to do when the active objects - e.g. table of objects - is not immediately in front of user?
3. Would a help be useful? - this could be a room where someone explains things. Not everyone has the Oculus First Steps. Could I make a button available which would put everything in front of the player - a comfort button/cushion?
4. Narrative / instructions not clear
5. If prep room activity not completed, should it be possible to still do the personal items collection?
6. When at airport - perhaps say 'you didn't complete the tasks, but here is your package anyway - well done for trying! Have a nice flight!!'

Problem is that not everyone has experienced VR. Gamers have an easier time of it, but those who do not have much gaming experience could struggle. How to make it easy? Comfortable?
