**I think I am going to chose one of the briefs put forward by the university.**

Why?

Because there are one or two that cover my bases and I can then concentrate on honing my ideas to the brief, which has got to be a good skill to practice, has it not?
I could do it the other way around in order to develop my technical skills, i.e. I could decide what I want to learn and practice, technically, and put together a brief that fits, but I'm not sure that this would outweigh what I would learn if I were to 'do it real'. 
There is also the greater potential to end up with a _real_ portfolio piece - one that will have been achieved for a _real_ client on a _real_ project. 
As a piece of work based on _Virtual Reality_, this would be a refreshing grounding.

**I wish I was better on the phone**

I always think of what I would like to have said after the phone has been put down and I begin the process of remembering what it was I really wanted to know or to contribute to the conversation. It is made worse by the knowledge that this ain't trivial! It's important! I need to be able to come away from these dismembered meetings knowing that there is nothing left to add or to glean except for "is there any way we can do this even quicker, because that was one amazing get-together and I don't know if we can wait much longer to get started!".

You can't always anticipate everything that will be said and how to repond, but it's worth putting in the time imagining these scenarios. I think, then, over time, with practice it will be possible to automatically get head into phone-mode. 

**Thoughts and lists** 

What do I want to say? .. don't forget don't forget don't forget!<br>
.. put down thoughts and create lists. <br>
Imagine what is likely to be discussed?<br>
.. more thoughts and lists. <br>
What will my responses be to these imagined scenarios?<br>
.. thoughts and lists. <br>
Lists and thoughts. <br>
Thoughts and lists. <br>
NEVER forget..<br>
