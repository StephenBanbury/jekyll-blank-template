## The Client Communication Log

When working with a client it is extremely important to keep a log of all communication with the client.
The CCL should cover the following: - 

* **Who:** Initiated the communication<br>
* **Where:** Meeting place, email, Skype, phone etc...<br>
* **When:** Time, date and duration<br>
* **Why:** The communication happened<br>
* **What:** The outcome was

Also include some initial reflections.

Some kind of coding system could be put in place to make it obvious what the communication was about.

CCL is a useful tool for the following reasons and benefits: -

* **Paper trail** - reducing potential for uncertainties. 
* **Avoiding repetition**
* **Keeping things regular** - keeping a record of discussions to ensure contact is regular
* **Managing multiple project** - dealing with more than one client and overlapping project - reducing stress and keeping track.
* **Transparency** - sharing the CCL with client, avoiding miscommunication.
* **Systematised** - make the CCL a formal process, maintaining consistency, especially working with a team etc.

## Most important way to keep client happy

_The Freelancer's Bible_ by Sara Horowitz: -

* **Be there** 
    * Video, voice calls and emails are viable options with no face-to-face available
    * Punctuality
    * Make client your priority
    * Never put the client on hold
    * Go the extra mile - give quick updates if no contact for a few days. Even after the project has finished contact them to ensure everything is fine - just to see how they are. Foster continuing relationship.
    * Clarify availability. Make it clear where boundaries are, hours of work. Focus on times available, not times you are not. 
    * Boundaries checklist. Helps manage expectations of when and how client can contact you. Go through the checklist with the client before starting the project as part of the on-boarding process. Flexibility may be needed: -
        * Communication practices - when and how you check voicemail and email
        * Weekend availability - maybe provide window of opportunity for emergencies
        * Check-ins - how? frequency? what communication channels will be used?
        * The structure of feedback
        * Decision makers - who makes the decisions/signs off work? ensure only one person has this role
        * Client requirements - are they a morning person, have to get kids to school etc.
        * Client policies and procedures - integrating with the culture of the client's organisation

* **Prepare**
    * Have everything you need around you before the meeting commences
    * Ovoid overloading the client with information. The Seven C's: -
        * Completeness - all information is presented
        * Concise
        * Clear
        * Concrete - vivid and clear, not ambiguous. Reinforce verbal agreements with documentation
        * Correct - factual, grammar etc.
        * Courteous 
        * Considerate

* **Care**
    * Be positive - what you can, not what you can't do. Don't take criticism personally
    * Respect the client's time
    * Transparency (_Make Your Mark: The Creative's Guide to Building a Business with Impact_ by Jcelyn K Glei)
        * Transparency breeds trust, and trust is the foundation of great teamwork.
        * Sharing all information is essential to innovation.
        * With openness, you attract loyalty.
        * Transparency leads to fairness and responsibility.
        * Transparency allows you to gain invaluable feedback.

## Open and Honest Communication 
> People need to be free, and to perceive that they are free, to offer suggestions. This includes ideas pertaining to one or more models, perhaps someone has a new way to approach a portion of the design or has a new insight regarding a requirement; the delivery of bad news such as being behind schedule; or simply the current status of their work. Open and honest communication enables people to make better decisions because the quality of the information that they are basing them on is more accurate.
