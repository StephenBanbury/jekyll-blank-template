## Chosen Brief

Light a firework... I have chosen a brief!

It's the ... drum roll....

**Shelter Box _Conference Booth Games_ Project!**

Having had two very constructive conversations with both potential clients, the main thing that swung it was the requirement of the Cornwall NHS Trust _Sowenna Sensory Room_ project to use their equipement, which is in Cornwall, wareas I am 6 hours away in Cardiff. 

Another consideration was that the product should be deliverable in a 'finished' state in March. This neither sits easily within the time frame available for the immediate project, nor for the one that is to follow. 

However, it was a very positive conversation I had with the project leader and we both expressed interest in my involvement in work related to future projects.

## Writing a proposal for the Shelter Box project

I began forming an idea for a prototype in my [**previous post**]({% link _posts/GAM740/2019-10-05-week-two-envisioning.markdown %}). Whilst I have further refined my ideas I don't wish to put them down too early, to allow for an iterative, agile approach in which the idea can develop as it progresses. So for now I will put together a proposal that is little more than an outline and a statement of one possible goal.

* Prototype of a game
* Player responds to incoming information / news about disasters
* Puts together a suitable Shelter Box from the available resources
* Assigns the box to a team who take it away
* As resources are depleated, the player will need to replenish them by ordering a fund-raising campaign or digging into existing reserves etc.
* The intensity and speed of incoming disasters increases over time, increasing sence of jeapordy.
* Game-play could be vary from simply grabbing resources from shelves, hangers, bags or hooks, to for example, floating around ready to grab as they pass.
* A player can never win in this game, but can achieve successes and suffer failures, accumulating points along the way.

## Returning to Envisioning as a process

I have put together the following: -

**Vision**

Through an engaging and enjoyable experience, using the emersive nature of a Virtual Reality environment, the product will inform the uninitiated of the core work undertaken by Shelter Box. User-interaction within a gamified experiencial environment, in which direct involvment is encouraged with the process of responding to crisis and emergency, will form the basis of a lasting and memorable experience, raising awareness and increasing the likelihood of potential involvment, at whatever level, with Shelter Box's work in the future.

**Backlog Creation / Epic** ([see definition](http://www.yodiz.com/blog/what-is-epic-in-agile-methodology-definition-and-template-of-epic/))

In a virtual 'control centre' setting, the 'player' will be confronted with a number of disaster scenarios that have recently or are currently taking place. The object will be, through actions such as directing appropriate resources and effective actions, to respond effectively in order to provide relief 'on the ground' whilst, at the same time, avoiding the obstacles and hindrances that inevitably serve to frustrate the process.

**Product Roadmap**

A roadmap outlining my releases will be in line with my sprints. I will work in three sprints of three weeks each. Suffice to say, sprint 1 begins at the start of week 4 and I intend to have a shippable product by the end of week 6. This will be a minimum viable product and will achieve the central goal already outlined - it will be playable, fun and informative, with the proviso that this is an agile process and things can, and probably will, change.

As always, change will be welcomed and change will be embraced!
