## Chosen Brief

Light a firework... I have chosen a brief!

It's the ... drum roll....

Shelter Box _Conference Booth Games_ Project!

Having had two very constructive conversations with both potential clients, the main thing that swung it was the requirement of the Cornwall NHS Trust _Sowenna Sensory Room_ project to use their equipement, which is in Cornwall, wareas I am 6 hours away in Cardiff. 

Another consideration was that the product should be deliverable in a 'finished' state in March. This neither sits easily within the time frame available for the immediate project, nor for the one that is to follow. 

However, it was a very positive conversation I had with the project leader and we both expressed interest in my involvement in work related to future projects.

## Writing a proposal for the Shelter Box project

I began forming an idea for a prototype in my [**previous post**]({% link _posts/GAM740/2019-10-05-week-two-envisioning.markdown %}). Whilst I have further refined my ideas I don't wish to put them down too early, to allow for an iterative, agile approach in which the idea can develop as it progresses. So for now I will put together a proposal that is little more than an outline and a statement of a realistic goal.

* Prototype of a game
* Player responds to incoming information / news about disasters
* Puts together a suitable Shelter Box from the available resources
* Assigns the box to a team who take it away
* As resources are depleated, the player will need to replenish them by ordering a fund-raising campaign or digging into existing reserves etc.
* The intensity and speed of incoming disasters increases over time, increasing sence of jeapordy.
* Game-play could be vary from simply grabbing resources from shelves, hangers, bags or hooks, to for example, floating around ready to grab as they pass.
* A pPlayer can never win in this game, but can achieve successes and suffer failures, accumulating points along the way.
