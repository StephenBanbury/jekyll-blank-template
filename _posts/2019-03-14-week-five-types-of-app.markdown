title: Week Five - Types of App
published: false
---

This week we have been considering the different types of app and the importance of understanding the markets in which they exist. I found this particularly interesting and useful. I came onto the course with an open mind as to the kind of direction I might follow and, although I've come across many of the types of app mentioned here, it is interesting to scrutinise their characteristics in order to categorised them and understand their placement within the existing markets.

As mentioned in my [Personal Case Study]({% link _posts/2019-03-10-week-six-personal-case-study.markdown %}), my intention was not necessarily to follow a path of game development. However, on the back of some game-like efforts as a response to the course assignments thus far, I have been analysing the meaning of the term, and whether this may be an area for exploration. Two types of app seem to stand out here - Serious Games and Gamification. The first relating to education apps, the second to what can be learned from game design and applied to non-game apps. Also, I find myself drawn to the idea of the Casual Creator App and the Experimental Art App. I believe there could be some interesting potential for exploration of the cross-overs between all these categories.

# **Market research**
The week's source material suggested some categories for consideration.  As I start to really think about the types of application that I may end up making as a Creative App Developer, I realise that understanding the **segmentation** of the market will be more than helpful in defining how and where my own products will fit. In a **saturated market**, it's all about engaging your audience and making your product distinguishable from other apps. **Trends** are ephemeral, fleeting, they come and go; but it was pointed out that some ideas can have a **'disruptive' effect**, bringing about permanent change and re-thinking of established patterns.

At this point, I will start considering the how the markets work and the ways in which finding a possible place in the market for a potential product - or realising it is actually best avoided altogether - should be approached. 

As a developer, at the forefront of your mind needs to be how best to engage your audience and to make your product distinguishable from others within the same field. For some time I've been considering the pros and cons of producing something that is entirely unique, as compared with something that would slot comfortably within an already established market. This is where Market Research really becomes so important. Taking time to understand the saturated markets we are faced with, analysing trends and patterns and getting to understand the type of apps that have been successes or failures, and the reasons for this, is vital. Central to this must be understanding your potential audience and whether or not, and how, their needs are being met. It seems to me that there is a risk in going out on a limb, but if you get it right there could be huge benefits. On the flip-side, it may seem safe to find and join a fairly established sector, but then you are running the risk of finding that your audience's needs are already being adequately catered for.

As was pointed out, there is a wholehearted need for objectivity and honesty, of being realistic and not too precious about your idea. It is all to easy to be tempted to sway market research in favour of your idea. Instead, it is good practice to seek advice from others, such as end users and developers.

# **Some interesting apps**<br>

>Question: What type of app do you think Circa 1948 could be classified as?<br>

<br>
I would call this a **_Serious Game_**. It immerses the 'player' in a by-gone, real, but unavoidably imaginary world.
Experience is created by the imagination - both of the designer and of the player. 
It must, by its very nature, involve a certain nostalgia for something that is now unobtainable. 
It is sublimation of the _ordinary_ experience of the past.
The experience nurtures a desire for something recognisable but unreachable.
It is installation art as app, or app as installation art.

**Circa 1948** reminds me of a TV programme about the [**BBC Berlin Blitz VR**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zk3cmfr) I came across recently.<br>
I have been struggling to find a link to this very interesting BBC children's (I think) TV programme, where school-age kids were trying out the VR app. The total immersiveness in the VR world recreated from actual recordings by a journalist accompanying the WW2 bombers on a raid over Berlin, was an incredible experience _in itself_ and brought into _reality_ a time and event that was hitherto unreachable and almost unimaginable for the young people. This could also be classed as a _serious game_: <br>
like _Circa 1948_, in as much as it is an experience, it is also a _game_; it is real and it is fabrication; it fires the imagination and teaches about past experience and of other times and other people; it is educational. 

These really forces one to consider, **what exactly is a game?!!**<br>

**Experimental Art App**<br>
‘Solstice’ – Bjork<br>
Biophilia app – not available any longer on Android? Can’t find it – is it too old?<br>
[on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm9g-SyvJRU)<br>
Cultural-creator,  art/cultural app<br>
I find this idea to be lots of fun!


SMART goal

consider each of my 'interesting' areas above and find an example of each. 
take an idea and form an ealy concept - consider its place in the market, laying out its strengths and weaknesses and how it could make money.
