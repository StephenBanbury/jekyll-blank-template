## Communities of Practice

**Movements and Professional Bodies** 

Over the years I have been slightly reluctant to entertain the idea of hitching myself up with an established **professional body**. I have always considered them to be for _other_ developers who were perhaps more concerned about their career than their 'art'. I was also probably put off, during my years as a self-employed developer, by the fact that they generally require a membership fee and demand more of my time and effort than I felt I was able to give or able to cash in on when I needed to get something out. Perhaps I have always had a bit of the Groucho Marx _"I donâ€™t want to belong to any club that would accept me as one of its members"_ attitude. It could be viewed as a little irrational but, nonetheless, I do have an aversion to belonging to recognised groups or clubs. In any case, for the years I have not been self-employed, most of the support I needed has been gained from working as part of a team. 

**Movements** are quite different in my view, as they have come about through a genuine shared aspiration to drive a particular passion or practice in a particular direction, to use the collective will of multiple like-minded people to further ideas and make a genuine and recognisable difference. 

## The Hacker and Maker Movements

>The hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of software systems to achieve novel and clever outcomes. The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed "hacking".<br>
&ndash; ['hacker culture' - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture)

>The maker movement ... is the umbrella term for independent inventors, designers and tinkerers. A convergence of computer hackers and traditional artisans, the niche is established enough to have its own magazine, Make, as well as hands-on Maker Faires that are catnip for DIYers who used to toil in solitude.<br>

_Maker culture_ intersects with _hacker culture_. Both share a DIY, [open-source](https://opensource.org/) ethos but, whereas hacker culture is concerned primarily with software, maker culture is more engineering-oriented, interested in such pursuits as electronics, robotics and 3D printing [['maker culture' - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture)].

Communities of practice and communities of interest tend to pop up around such movements. Without making much of a real effort to associate myself with a specific community, it's fair to say that at various times I have existed on the fringes of several - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [SQLServerCentral](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/) spring to mind. This has been generally unintentional and borne out of necessity, for, without the knowledge, advice and support they can provide, I would have struggled to achieve much.

>... by programmers, for programmers, with the ultimate intent of collectively increasing the sum total of good programming knowledge in the world. No matter what programming language you use, or what operating system you call home. Better programming is our goal.<br>
&ndash; [codinghorror](http://blog.codinghorror.com/introducing-stackoverflow-com/)

Life as a developer would be very difficult without StackOverflow. Most coding-related queries put out as Google searches return a number of possible answers from the forum, via the same or similar questions having already been asked by its members. Over the years it has become clear just how precious this resource is for those who have become involved. The expected, or even _required_ etiquette - an important feature of belonging to such a community - is so passionately enforced and the rewards, in terms of **reputation** points and virtual **medals**, so sought-after, that I am sometimes surprised at the fervour with which they are gathered. Kudos is very highly prized. 

In this week's article on Communities of Practice, Alcwyn Parker advises identifying a potential _mentor_ or _role model_ to aid integration. I have seen this at work first-hand: a recent new colleague of mine, who will happily tell you that he is very much part of the stack overflow community, has demonstrated the importance the community's particular etiquette, in terms of methods and expectations for posting and answering questions and ensuring that your own questions receive the best response possible in super-quick time by offering virtual 'bounty' for the most useful answer. It's easy to see how such a community can form and grow together as it develops its own social culture, including rules and accepted etiquette that help to define itself and legitimise its existence, to set it out to be unique and 'owned' by the community members themselves.   

>Legitimation in the social sciences refers to the process whereby an act, process, or ideology becomes legitimate by its attachment to norms and values within a given society. It is the process of making something acceptable and normative to a group or audience.<br>
&ndash; ['legitimation' - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimation)

The result is a community that plays an important part in making information available and providing support along with the benefit of experience. The sense of community and of belonging is vital in achieving its inherently altruistic aims, which are borne of a desire to share and constantly improve the quality of knowledge and developmental practice generally.

## The Falmouth 'Creative App Development' Community 

![The Falmouth 'Creative App Development' Community](\images\falmouth-banner.jpg)

Reflecting on how my own ideas have developed and expanded in the short time I've been on this MA course, I can see that I have moved from a fairly narrow idea of the possible direction of my personal development, towards one that is beginning to encompass a wider set of possibilities. This is partly due to the sharing of knowledge and experience between practitioners - students, academic staff, external or loosely-affiliated contributors - who are, in their own ways, following personal, loosely-related paths and have come to form a community of sorts, at least partly unintentionally. As I have become less isolated from outside and diversified influences, my general outlook has begun moving away from the idea that my creative future lies almost solely in web development and, although the web is very likely to remain important to me, I have been increasingly made aware of other attractions and areas of potential interest. 

This is unlikely to have happened without coming to 'belong' to a group that share interests and ambitions as creative app developers. Following this train of thought, I can see that intentionally associating myself with groups, communities and movements, with similar interests, goals and aspirations, can potentially provide fuel for driving the further development of ideas and skills, whilst providing the support that can be vital when following a path that is actually quite personal. 

## Researching communities

As I do not have much knowledge or experience of the various communities and associated events or activities associated with the Hacker and Maker movements, I would like to find out more and get some idea of those I may be interested in involving myself with. 

I also find myself drawn to the interests and ethea inherent in the maker movement.  Although I have no direct experience, I find the potential of playing with the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms and, in particular, getting involved with electronics and robotics, to be very appealing. To this end, I will create a SMART goal to undergo research into relevant and interesting Hacker and Maker communities.

* **Make it Specific:** The goal is to research Hacker and Maker movement communities and select those that appear to be aligned with my own interests and goals, as well as offering potential for expanding into new personal territories.
* **Make it Measurable:** I will document my research and my conclusions and create a journal entry. Where necessary, I will contact the most interesting groups for further information.
* **Make it Attainable:** This will be achieved within a single week.
* **Make it Relevant:** At the end of this process, I will have learned more about the types of communities that exist and have a list of those that I find to be personally interesting and which I may involve myself with. I will have been in contact with those that are most interesting to me.
* **Make it Time-Based:** I will devote three sessions to this: one for research, another for drawing up conclusions and another for writing a journal and contacting those of greatest interest.

## Summary

I have discussed my interest in the Hacker and Maker movements and the kinds of communities that are associated with them. I have used my experience with _Stack Overflow_ as an example of how such a community can operate and achieve its aims. I've also looked at how a _creative app development_ community has emerged from the shared interests of my fellow students, academic staff and contributors at Falmouth and seen how this has begun to change and expand my interests and horizons in terms of my own developmental pathway. Finally, I have created a SMART goal to undergo research into relevant communities of practice and to begin getting involved with any that are of particular interest to me.
