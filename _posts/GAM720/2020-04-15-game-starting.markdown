How to start and end the game? The player needs to be prepared and ready for action.

# Starting the game

I ended up spending much time on this and getting it right is not a simple thing.  I imagine it to be something that is helped hugely by experience in game design.

The environment now resembles a theatre in some respects. There is a 'stage', where the action happens, a curtain of sorts that keeps all the initial preparation for the 'performance' from the audience's view, and a futher curtain that I refer to as the 'fire curtain', again after the theatre. This final curtain came about as a means to hide what is in effect the means to get the game going. Initially I began the game with a spoken narrative welcoming the player and explaining the situation, before presenting them with a button to press to open the main curatin and start working on disaster deployment. However, I discovered that this was actually placing the player too far into the introduction, and really, it is they that needs to set the game in motion - hence the final 'fire' curtain, which only opens when the 'play' button has been pressed. It is at this point that the introductions begin, resulting in the user being offered the keyboard in order to enter their name (which will ulitmately be used to update the leaderboard).

All these curtain were a bit boring to watch, so I updated the fire curtain to an animation of the word _ShelterBox_ - perfectly satisfactory for the pupose of providing enough interest whilst explaining the game without providing too much of a distraction.

Entering the player's name allows the welcome to be personalised with a message on the backdrop. I may update this to become some form of **placard or a gilded sign**, extending the personal touch and further engaging the player.

All taken into concideration, this reasonably satisfactory, and should suffice for the purpose of this game in the shorter term, but I expect to make improvements at some point once the all-important gameplay is working well.
