# Building and animating the player character

The tutorial has a useful introduction to [building and animating the player character(s)](https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/pun/v2/demos-and-tutorials/pun-basics-tutorial/player-prefab). This is not PUN-specific so comes as an unexpected but welcome addition, as character animation is something that I will need to look into sooner or later.

The robot prefab is provided for demo/experimental purposes as part of the Photon PUN 2 asset download, as are the animations required to get him moving (running, swinging arms etc.). These need attaching to the robot GameObject along with a character controller and the usual collision detector etc. The tutorial provides help on this and setting the animator in motion. However, I am clear that I will need to learn how to create 3D objects like this, as well as build character animations.
