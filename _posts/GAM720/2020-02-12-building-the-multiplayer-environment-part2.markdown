# Building and animating the player character

The tutorial has a useful introduction to [building and animating the player character(s)](https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/pun/v2/demos-and-tutorials/pun-basics-tutorial/player-prefab). This is not PUN-specific so comes as an unexpected but welcome addition, as character animation is something that I will need to look into.

>Read as much as you can on the topic and what you'll find when searching the web for this. After you understood the concept, you'll be able to make the most out of many Unity features when it comes to animation and consistent control of values over time
