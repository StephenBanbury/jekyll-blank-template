# _It is becoming evident that notions of environment could be a good place to begin_

Here I am concerned with the immediate virtual space that the immersive experience participant finds themselves.

My experience creating virtual reality prototypes for ShelterBox in the previous module has encouraged me to consider, in greater depth, the benefits or otherwise of the nature and qualities of the immersive environment. As the single most important aspect of the immersive experience in that it encompasses and affects all others, the created environment appears to be top of the list. Ultimately, I will be looking for ways of encouraging the participant to **hang around**, so I will need to consider how and to what extent the nature of environment affects the overall experience.  

Some possible subjects for research and consideration could include: -

* The use of a familiar environment, such as using the model I created of the family home imported into Unity from Sketch-up.

* How would familiar environment or familiar objects affect reaction to the environment compared with those that are unfamiliar or custom-made?

* How would personal welcome messages and familiar sounds affect the way the environment is received?

* Could I introduce the use of voice synthesis - perhaps this could be controlled by text input by a teacher/therapist/player?

* How environment affects levels of relaxation, stimulation, engagement etc.

* What makes a good therapeutic environment?

* In what way is comfort affected by colour and colour schemes?

* How does the use of sound or music affect the environment and how does the type of music or quality of sound affect the participant's disposition?

* Would something like a Zen environment be a suitable place to begin these experiments?
