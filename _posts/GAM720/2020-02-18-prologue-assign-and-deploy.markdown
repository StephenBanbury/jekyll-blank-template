# **_"Welcome Alex. Thank you for volunteering. We have a critical situation. There are a number of disasters that require your urgent attention..."_**

<div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 1.4em;">
Alex is an office administrator. He volunteered for ShelterBox because it looked interesting and something different to do with his time. Well, okay.. it was partly this, but also it was because he’d watched and listened to the news for what seemed like his entire life feeling detached from the important and significant events around the world.. those he could only witness from a distance. <br><br>
He now felt he had discovered something new. Doors had been opened. Suddenly, he had found an opportunity to pack his bags and go out there, in person, to help those who had just experienced disaster at close quarters. In fact, maybe he didn't have to remain outside it all any longer. Perhaps he would now be able to look people directly in the eye and try to understand, to really understand, what they had been through. At the very least he could now maybe help out in some way - grab a warm blanket and put it around the shoulders of someone who had not experienced such simple pleasure for weeks, or drop off a box containing medication that could mean more than he could imagine to a family for whom only a few days ago things had looked so bleak!<br><br>
At least, this was his ambition. But first, Alex needed to step into the uncomprising world of Distaster Response Preparation. It is a tough job, but someone has to do it, and why shouldn't that someone be Alex?!<br><br>
Alex walked into the <span style="font-style: italic;">Response Room</span>. It was as he expected – a serious room defined by serious intentions. “Welcome Alex”, said a calm female voice that appeared to come from everywhere. “Your willingness to help is much appreciated. We are currently experiencing extremely high levels of disruption to everyday lives on a global scale. Current pressure ratings are at dangerous levels. We are relying on your calm efficiency, pragmatism and intelligence to help bring us back to within calm and sustainable levels. Are you willing to engage?”.<br><br>
“Yes, I am”, said Alex.<br><br>
The sound of well-insulated electronically controlled servers whirred into action with the kind of slick precision associated with German engineering. From within the rather bland looking counter incongruously sitting in front of him, three monitor screens slid into view that seemed to embody a cold, machine-grade sense of expectation. Simultaneously, an opening emerged and, from within, appeared the first of a series of disaster relief resource holograms. Alex had not noticed at first, but each screen appeared to be suspended above what looked like large, bottomless boxes, coloured in the standard ShelterBox Blue and designed to withstand the kind of treatment handed out by Ryanair on a short-staffed bank holiday weekend.<br><br>
“These resources are precious. Please assign them carefully to the displayed disasters. Don’t forget: be cool; be careful. Diligent planning can help more people; too much attention to a single cause can mean failure for so many others.”<br><br>
“Alex, good luck!”
