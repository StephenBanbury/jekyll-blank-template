# Colour Wheel

I will update this with a more professional job shortly!

# Colour palettes created from photographs

The task is to create our own palettes from our own images. As time is limited for me, I chose to use some of my favourite pictures from my travels in Central and South America some time back. The diverse habitats and colours to be found in Peru and Bolivia are stunningly diverse and have remained strong in my memory. I'm sure they will for a long time to come.

I chose to experiment with some of the online colour tools mentioned in my post on [**colour tools**](/2020/02/19/colour-scheme-design-apps.html). I enjoyed the results, in terms of the number of colours that could be picked from to make a palette, produced by **[ColourLovers Photocopa](https://www.colourlovers.com/photocopa)**, by the makers of **Copasa**. You do have to create an account - which is free - to be able to use this tool, but there are a number of benefits, such as being able to save your palettes and sharing with others in the **ColourLover**'s online community of colour enthusiasts. It is possible to access the hexadecimal and RGB values for each colour - although it's not as easy a task as it should be or is possible in some of the other apps. However, the ColourLovers site also includes a number of other useful-looking tools for a variety of colour work and image creating tasks.
