## Attempts at finding a way to make this game compelling


As I explore ideas I will, no doubt about it, find that some of my attempts to make this game compelling, simply fail. Others, hopefully, can be rescued and built upon.

1. **Resource object time-out:** I have added a timer to the collectable resource objects, which begins count-down the moment an object is picked up. If the object is still being held when the counter reaches zero then object is destoyed and placed back in its box. The mechanic is in place, but how it is used is not defined just yet. Currently, the length of time available for the player to keep hold of the object before dispatching it to a disaster scenario reduces as the game progresses, but the potential is there for this to be used as an added complexity, perhaps adding an incentive to keep the budget levels high. 
2. **Resources cost money:** Each resource object has a price tag, and the availble budget is reduces by each resource deployment. 
3. **Funds can be raised:** A random fund-raising event is displayed on the computer screen next to the player and the player has the option to initiate one of these when the budget gets low. Currently this just sets the budget back to its initial value, but I will be working on the mechanic to add complexity. For instance, each event has an estimated potential funding return which can be used as a base for a psuedo random actual value. I also imagine the event to take some time before any funds are made available - after all, realistically time must be allowed for planning etc. and an event can only take place some time after it has been given the go-ahead. I am also thinking of giving a short window to select the event before it vanishes. It may be that the player has to wait with no funds before another event becomes available.
