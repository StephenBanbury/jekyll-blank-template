# Notes on colour theory

Colour is subject experience.

Perception of frequencies of light.

Part physical, part interpretational

Subconscious

Choice influenced by colour.

Importance: shape --> colour --> content

Cultural, non-universal

Umberto Eco (1985) - neither psychologial nor aesthetic - cultural - linguistic

    verbal language makes the non-verbal recognisable

**So much in common with music!**

Important to make the right colour choices - evoke emotions
Colour mistakes can have a lasting negative impact on your brand.

Neil Balingher

Appeal, usability, accessibility of app.

**[Apple](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/)** and **[Google](https://brandpalettes.com/google-colors/)** provide documentation about use of appropriate colour for their products.

Microsoft has **[UI Fabric](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric)**

And then there's **[Meterial Design](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#)**


**Accessibility** - colour blindness - 'colour vision deficiences'
