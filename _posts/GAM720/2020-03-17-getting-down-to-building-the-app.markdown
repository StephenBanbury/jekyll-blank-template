## Serious business

The prototyping phase was in large part about taking on an air of whistfulness and experimenting without too much to worry about - after all, the worst that could happen would be that things go wrong, you blog about it, learn your lessons, make improvements and decisions, and continue to iterate towards a working prototype. Ultimately, while of course you want to make something great and hope for it to be accepted to be taken forward for further development, only you and your client (including stakeholders) will get to see it. 

We are now in a whole new ball-park. Now, I'm thinking, "Gulp"! After all, the NEC will be watching!

I have begun easing myself back into developing the app. It's still surprising how difficult it can be to get going after three months away from it. Remembering where I was, how it works... all stuff that seemed so close to my psyche that I was living it and dreaming it has now become almost alien code in some places. I've been at it for a few days (a few hours each day) now and it's come back on the whole. There's a lot of code I've had to do away with because I'm only working not on one of the three main prototype ideas, but I am keeping it in place for now as I may regret losing it. It's safety first here.

I've eased myself back into the process by bringing in gentle improvements: aesthetically at first, such as increasing the size of the monitors, replacing the free asset treasure chests with self-made boxes. I then added the rudiments for a new gameplay feature - the reducing budget. Each resource now has an associated cost which is used to respectively recude the starting budget everytime a resource is deployed. 

I then organised that, in the prototype, random pile of resource objects are thrown into the boxes with an ordered selection, organised per type into their own resource 'bins'. By this point I'm getting comfortable with coding this app again.

I added video players to each monitor screen - but now I'm aware I need to create videos as the ShelterBox asset bank does not appear to contain any - I had though they had. I think I'll be able to cobble some slide-based videos together using photos. Not ideal, but it will do if I don't find anyinb better.

These additions, though, only go to highlight that a **narrative** needs to be created and implemented. What happens with this budget when I get to zero! This is a moment when the narrative has stopped allowing the player to sit back. Ideas that I had that were slightly vague and unfocused are now needing to focus and move from the ephemeral to something that is real, existing in an actual gamespace and achieving goals that are predefined. There is still plenty of experimentation, plenty of unknown territory. But now this is underpineed and, in many ways, resulting form the new position I and my creation have found themselves.

So... what does happen when the budget has been exhausted?


# Power-up the budget

This could potentially entirely replace the countdown timer. As a gameplay device, the countdown is not necessarily a great tool - an artificial way to create pressure. It would maybe worth finding a playful way to disguise the timer element in a gameplay device that is less obvious or crude. This is worth researching, but it would seem better to build the jeopardy into the narrative itself. For example, if it is _**Game Over**_ when budget reaches Â£0.00 then keeping the budget in the black is essential. If it becomes increasingly difficult to do so, then this is the defining characteristic of the game's problem. If it is made to be extremely difficult to play beyond 5 minutes then this becomes, in effect, the timer in another form.

**Some thoughts on gameplay: How could a power-up work?**

* The budget runs down as you assign resources and it needs regular replenishment. There are a number of fund-raising activities to chose from - selected from a touch-screen next to the player.
* Or selected from a panel of buttons.
* Each time an object is picked up there is a short countdown in which time the player has to assign the resource, or else it vanishes. This time gradually reduces as the game progresses. Alternatively, the time reduces as the budget decreases. The trick would be make sure that replenishing the budget is not too easy, or gets harder as the game progresses.
* Throw something through a hoop or hole, or at a target to replenish the budget.
* Phone rings intermittently and a voice offers new donations to boost budget.
* The control room is gradually ripped apart by an increasingly fierce hurracane.

The latter I would love to play with if I have time. It would require incorporating one of my prototypes from GAM740 - the disaster scene with high winds picking up and throwing cars and park benches etc. Perhaps I could place the control room in this high wind zone and add colliders to the building's walls, ceiling, furniture etc.
