# _Polyphony_ 
> A musical texture created by multiple individual and independent parts<br>

The idea that I will be taking forward for this project is to use Virtual Reality in the creation of an immersive space in which two 'players' can join together to create sonic and visual effects and events, though physical actions and interactions. The results of such actions may be seen as ephemeral visual and aural moments that exist for a short time after an event is triggered. The space will be an environment in which the players can experiment and create through playful interactions with the space, the objects within it, and the players themselves.<br>


# _Cacophony_
> A harsh, discordant, jarring, mixture of sounds<br>

For me, as the developer, this will be a vehicle to exlore, not only the technical problems, issues and solutions involved in creating such an event, but also to attempt to use freedom from the physical world in order to transend the nature of objects as we understand them, pushing the possibilities of how we can expect them to react, sonically and visually, as the result of actions directed upon them.<br>

It will be interesting to witness not only how participants interact with these stimuli within a shared space, but also how each interacts with the other. Will there be an attempt to create something collaboratively, in the mode of a 'jam', or will they find there is too much stimuli to comfortably handle, resulting in the need to escape? <br>

# _Phony_ 
>Fake, not genuine or real<br>

With regard to the immersive environment, how does the nature and aesthetic quality of the virtual space itself affect how the players react to it and to each other? And, through the exploration of sound in virtual reality, will it be possible to explore the accoustic qualities of the space and how, for instance, artificial sound waves bounce off virtual surfaces?<br>

It may be that I find a way to 'record' the event so that it can be replayed and experienced from a different perspective, viewed as a creative artefact 'object', that is experienced rather differently to the live event that caused it to come into existence. <br>
