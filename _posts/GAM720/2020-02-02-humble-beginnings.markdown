## Forming an idea

**My initial idea** stems from twin desires to create a collaborative, interactive, ‘multi-player’ space in Virtual Reality and to develop ways for educational or therapeutic (such as autistic spectrum disorder) activities to take place.

My starting point will be to create a suitable immersive space to be ‘shared’ by student and teacher. I will explore the use of avatars as representations of the participants and will study this in comparison with a lack of visual human representation. Initially, the student will use the VR headset and the teacher will use a phone or tablet.

I will introduce a simple interactive concept based on question and response, or action and reaction. The teacher will ask something of the student and will provide a suitable reward if the response is satisfactory. 

As I have an interest in sound and music, I will approach this as part of an exploration of sound creation and manipulation within a virtual space. For this to happen, some kind of participant action will clearly be required as will both sonic and visual elements within the space.

This will enable me to begin studying the possibilities and effectiveness of immersive technologies in therapeutic and education settings. It will also allow me to experiment with visual and aural aesthetics and the inclusion of visual human interaction, all with the potential to gain insights into human response.




# As I further develop my idea...

I begin to think about how the narrative, along the lines of **storyworld** rather than **storyline**, can be more interesting. If this were to be more of a game rather than _simply_ responding to a set of given tasks. Perhaps this can be along the lines of a _spree_, where the 'student' returns a series of _correct_ responses, only for this to fail as soon as an _incorrect_ response is given. Similar to a game of **Simon**.

This is, of course a very simple game. 

**Research**

My first search for a VR version of Simon unearthed what I initially thought must be an _Augmented Reality_ version of the game, requiring a Microft Hololens or something equally sophisticated.

But in fact it turned out to be a simple piece of hardware that consists of coloured LEDs and responds to proximity of an object - vis the player's hand - to detect if the correct choice of colour/sound has been made. This game looks novel, but I am certain it would become extremely tiring and annoying in a very short time.
