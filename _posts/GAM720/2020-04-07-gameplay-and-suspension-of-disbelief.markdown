## How making the game more like a game makes it more like reality

# This is strange, isn't it?

I've been striving to make my game more like a 'proper' game, knowing that this will aid the sense of immersion for the player. However, I wasn't really ready for how much this really does happen! It doesn't matter that the actions within the game - animations, sounds, responses to input and stimulii - could potentially be increasingly removed from what is real, in terms of actually real and expected within normal real-world physical situations and resulting from real-world physical interactions. The feeling of immersion increases as I increase the number of animations and game devices, as long as they adhere to a 'seriousness' and are not too frivolous in a way that could be viewed as self-indulgent. If the game believes it, then the player is asked to also believe it, and the player is all too happy to oblige.

Perhaps we are so used to games in modern culture that these have been accepted into and as reality. Media such as film, TV, games etc, along with the increasing aborbsion into the mainstream of ways to interact with our world via artiface and interface, have formed a kind of new relationship with reality and, in fact, caused a playful 'fourth wall' to come into being - in order to be broken - between ourselves and our reality. Reality is boring. Let's create an alternative one that distorts or enhances it. This is much more fun! The 20th Century was in many ways, the centure of drugs and alternaive ways of seeing, opening the 'doors of perception'. It's perfectly fitting and proper that we should feel comfortable immersing ourselves within a made up world, as long as the world itself can convince us that it is real. Even better if it adds value and it an improvement on what we are currently lumbered with!
