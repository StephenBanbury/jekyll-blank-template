A notion of fiction particularly relevant to Creative App Development: -
_"An imaginary thing or event, postulated for the purpose of argument or explantion"_
 - User Stories

Personnas - fictional characters - research

# Speculative Design / Design Fiction

**Ficionalised Design**

Virtual Reality

_The Neuromancer_ - Willilam Gibson, 1984

Consentual Halucinations. Or as facebook would have it: _Social VR_

Much of this kind of fiction is about future technologies and the relationships we foster with them.


_"Speculative Anything"_ - (Doon & Mabby? (link TBC) )

**Non-linear, interactive fiction** - where the user makes choices and is not simply taken on a journey designed by the designer. Concept that has captured the imagination of game developers and interactive artists.

In terms of my own work, it should be interesting to speculate on how the user interacts with my design and created environment, how their journey unfolds, how they may chose to engage and explore. Non-linear interaction - my users will make the choices, they have agency over their own journey.

Take risks and experiment (this is how I like things!).

## Narrative Design


There appears to be a difference between _Narrative_ and _Interaction_
One is linear, a story and is authored
The other is non-linear, more like a conversation and is identifiable as providing input / user-choice.

# On Plot

Carefully crafted, designed. <br>
Players altering a plot can ruin the plot / structure, with loss of narrative.<br>
Players being forced into plot can result in loss of interactive strength.

As a designer one can create a space in which the player acts. 
* Cannot directly control events
* Can directly control rules
* Create a storyworld, not a storyline
* The overaching narrative/goals/challenges can be defined
