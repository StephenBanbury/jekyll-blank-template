# Speculative Design / Design Fiction

**Ficionalised Design**

Virtual Reality

_The Neuromancer_ - Willilam Gibson, 1984

Consentual Halucinations. Factbook - _Social VR_

Much of this kind of fiction is about future technologies and the relationships we foster with them.


_"Speculative Anything"_ - Doon & Mabby **(find link to website)**

**Non-linear, interactive fiction** - where the user makes choices and is not simply taken on a journey designed by the designer. Concept that has captured the imagination of game developers and interactive artists.

In terms of my own work, it should be interesting to speculate on how the user interacts with my design and created environment, how their journey unfolds, how they may chose to engage and explore. Non-linear interaction - my users will make the choices, they have agency over their own journey.

**Narrative Design**

Take risks and experiment.
