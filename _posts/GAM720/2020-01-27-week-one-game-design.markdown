I would not describe myself as a 'gamer'. I don't really play games these days, but that's not to say I do not appreciate the art.

This module appears to be designed to draw inspiration from games, if not encourage game design or development in itself. I find myself much more drawn to the topic than I would have thought at the start of the course, a year ago. Earlier journal posts, my course work, and during webinars and general conversation, it is fairly clear that my appreciation of the concept of games, in the widest and most loosely-formulated sense, in terms of design and development in relation to their purpose and the roles they can play within the wider sphere of app development, has swiftly become almost integral to my own direction of travel. That is not to say I expect or hope to become a game designer in the purest sense - this is for those who have devoted their lives to gaming and have developed an inate and sympathetic feel for games that maybe I once posessed but have long since left behind. However, games, or the ideas behind what makes a game, how games engage us and capture our attention, spark our imagination, attempt to free us from our more mundane sense of being and challenge us to improve ourselves, does intrigue me. I am interested in how game systems, strategies, rewards and hooks can instigate a drive to compete, progess, succeed and to overcome obstacles and prevail, and how this can be harnessed beyond the pure idea of gaming for the sake of gaming.

Education has been shown to be an obvious and significant beneficiary [reference]. And education itself is a diverse area.  

# Peer Discussion

We were asked to discuss our 'favourie game' - a wide topic, and one that could be taken in many directions. 

> What is your favourite game and why? It could be anything from board games, party games, video games or even something that involves adding a layer of play on top of your everyday tasks. 

My response: -

_I'm struggling with this one a bit. I don't really game (I love how this has become a verb) much, any more. I probably started to fry the gaming part of my brain when I was a young teen and then finally frazzled it in my early 30s. Saying that, I'm finding I'm starting to get back into games a little, partly due to  my 11 year old son and partly due to a kind of gentle road-to-Damascus series of rediscovery-renaissance experiences via this MA.  Starting to work in Virtual Reality is playing a significant part in this, as is the concept of gamification and the significance of games in education._

_Then again, I've always loved a good game of chess._

_Games, both of the computer or non-computer variety, have played their part at various stages in my life. Snakes and ladders, ludo, cluedo, monopoly, Escape From Colditz (https://tinyurl.com/qoa39kz (Links to an external site.)) etc. as a child, for example. I have particularly fond memories of the London Cabbie Game (https://tinyurl.com/ua2whqp (Links to an external site.)). Card games were an important part of hanging out in shared housing or as a student._

_As a young wide-eyed arcade gamer back in the 80s I loved nearly everything that had a 10p or 20p slot (my pocket money and that of my peers must have built this industry). I remember the early ping-pong games appearing in my local chippie.  Followed by Space Invaders,  Pacman, Scramble, Galaxians, Gorf, then platformers like Donkey Kong.  Defender was an unbelievably amazing, crazy game that was about as immersive as a 2D space shoot-em-all game could be back then. The sounds of these games are as memorable as the gameplay, and when I hear the noises now I can smell the arcades. As a proud owner of a BBC Micro Model B, I reserve a particularly special place in my heart for Elite (https://tinyurl.com/vf6s4z8 (Links to an external site.)). This was the most cutting edge game of its time and marks the beginning of a whole new genre of video/console games._

_I've always loved driving games, but only if they are realistic. Forget style over substance - it has to be authentic, like the real thing. Same for flying, shooting, being in space.  I think this is probably what I am beginning to feel the love for more than anything when it comes to modern gaming. Although I've not played this game much myself I'm beginning to get a fascination watching my son play Zelda, Breath Of The Wild.  He loves the freedom it gives him to explore and make his own way whilst feeling about as real as can be,  and it looks amazing!_

_I am now getting excited about the possibilities of virtual, augmented and mixed reality - surely this is going to be huge and has the potential to take the concept of what a game is onto another level._

# In brief: thoughts on the module outline

In terms of my early thinking about this project, I am scatterlogically finding these kind of thoughts bouncing around my head, as a result of what I would like to explore myself and the generally intriguing titles of the, as yet, unlocked weekly content to come. As the course content and requirements become known and, of course, the actual work I do takes form, these will no doubt change to greater or lesser degress and new ideas should form. As ever, it will be interesting to see how this progresses.

1. **Game Design**.  

2. **Fictional Worlds & Game Mechanics**. Vital stuff for game creators. Very much looking forward to this as it's new learning for me.
3. **Suspension of Disbelief**. I presume this will be about making the impossible into reality or, as I touched up above, creating worlds that make demands on our imagination and pull us out of our 'normal' existence.
4. **Colour Theory**. Something I missed out on at art college, but is clearly important in app development. I want my apps to look good as this can make such a difference. I'm sure something that looks good and feels good has an advantage over something that maybe more sophisticated. If user does not like being there, they will stay away. Web design has really developed this field in recent times.
It will be worth considering the importance of an app, or immersive environment or characters within it, looking aesthetically pleasing, in comparison to the importance of being functionally-enticing, useful, exciting, fun etc. Is being able to maniuplate your environment to your own ends more important than a slick-looking environment that is proviced to you from the outset?
5. **Concept Art**. I have spent time considering this, as an undergraduate and generally. I am interested to see how the topic is discussed in relation to our art as app developers. 
6. **Character Design**. A new skill for me, and potentially an important one with regard to multi-player / interactive immersive experiences and ways of relating in the virtual world with my target audience, i.e. ASD. Character design versus downloadable professionally-created assets - which is suitable for what purpose?
7. **Sound Design**. My bag in my world outside app development and something I've been looking forward to engaging with. I'm considering how sound and 'musical' sound can be embraced as a means for providing a level of immersion that goes beyond the visual, which is far more prevelant and understood, I think.
8. **Sound Process**. Not sure what this is. Is this sound and the process of using it, or 'sound' as in 'stable', 'safe', 'reliable'?
9. **3D Art**. Clearly an important subject when it comes to VR.
10. **Animation**. I have briefly dabbled with animation - 2D using javascript and javascript libraries and game engines,and 3D via Unity - and it is an area that I am looking forward to focusing on at little more. 


# First thoughts and development of ideas

**Virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality**. All seem to hold the potential to explore and push the 'evolution' of games further along, including notions of what games are, how we understand games in terms of their function as human activity and expressions of human nature. I am interested in how aspects of gaming can potentially be captured and used as tools for learning, particularly when combined with the intensely immersive qualities of VR. With this in mind, the idea of shared virtual experience particularly interests me and I intend to explore some of the potential, if it exists, of 'multi-player', 'chat-room' or similar platforms to facilitate the building of 'bonds of trust' in order to gain the attention of the participant as 'student', with the aim of aiding the process of learning.

As has been explained in earlier posts, I have a personal interest in ASD - Autism Spectrum Disorder - and ultimately I would like to take steps to discover if there is the potential for immersive VR to create environments where learning is made easier; or, at least, to create another place where learning can happen, perhaps taking on a different form from those that are more established. The intention is not to create environments that 'simply' replace those that are real, natural, unavoidable, in order to provide relief or respite for the participant - although this could be recognised as a noteworthy by-product - or to make life easier for those in close contact, such as family. Instead, I would like to explore whether, perhaps, the clarity of objects - visual, aural, interactive - and of the individuals respresented within these environments, can help to focus the attention of the student and engage them in such a way that action, feedback and reward - in whatever form this may take - are clear and precise to the participant, uncluttered and unaffected by distracting or distressing background 'noise'. 

As I do not have a formal practical or academic background as an _Educationalist_, I am aware that there are questions that I may have that ultimately turn out to have been already discussed, answered or dismissed as irrelevant. However, perhaps some need to be raised again, albeit with a new slant due to the continual advancement of technology, along with the ever-changing nature of society's response to it. Therefore, I am approaching this topic perhaps a little _wide-eyed_ and naive. However, the expectation that the GAM720 module is approached from an experimental perspective, backed up by appropriate and thorough research, should make for an interesting journey. I only hope I find some answers and open avenues for further exploration of these thoughts and ideas.


* **Multi-player:** Looking at ways of more than one person joining in the VR experience. How can student-teacher interaction take place? 

* **Option 1:** the student experiences the environment and the teacher remains outside of this, but is able to manipulate the environment in real-time?

* **Option 2:** the student and teacher to join each other in the envoronment with the potential of interacting with each other? 

* **Facial expressions:** can they be simulated within VR? This could be an important part of ASD thereutic research.

* **physical interactions:** Can I move beyond the normal expected kind of user interactions with their environment, such as picking up and throwing objects, pressing buttons, pushing objects etc? I would like to experiment with turning and twisting, clapping, shaking etc. What happens if expected outcomes do not arise but are replaced by the unexpected, scrambling cause and effect? Could this be used to create 'puzzle' games? For example where clapping causes water to change colour or pushing a block causes a balloon to expand. 

* **Hand tracking:** recently this become available for the Oculus Quest with no extra hardware or software required.

* **sound:** used within immersive environments what effect can sound have on the participant? In what why does it affect how the partipant experiences the visual aspects of the space?

* **Vocalisation:** How can the participant's own voice be used to communicate and/or affect the environment. How can it be used in general communication. Maybe speech therapy could be considered as a possible outcome.

# Environment

Environmental considerations can be found [here]({% link _posts/GAM720/2020-01-29-vr-environment.markdown %})


# Social VR

A shall be researching **social VR**. This will involve looking at how Occulus, in particular, are developing the concept of the **Avatar** in creating a presence in the immersive environment.
