## Dog Walker Simulator

Crystal is a dog-walker by profession. She has build a trusting client base over the past 5 years and, through the dogs, has made many friends - or at least that's how she likes to see them.

On this particular, unusual, day, the dogs seem to be behaving rather differently to the lovely calm creatures she has become used to. Fido, for some unfathomable reason, has decided to snap at Tia whenever she comes close. This is a problem, particularly as she is tethered to the lead next to Fido. Thankfully, the app on her phone, which shows the georgeous little pooches via glorious Augmented Reality, allows Crystal to move Tia to the other side of the pack. 

Unfortunately, this now means that Rusty is next to Fido, and Rusty seems to have picked up a severe case of unwelcome, itchy, leaping, guests (flees). These begin jumping from Rusty onto Fido's coat. Fido begins scratching, which causes the pack to swerve to the right! Luckily, the app allows Crystal to tug at the lead and bring Fido back into line. 

Meanwhile, Benji has picked up the odor of a freshly-cooked pie that has been left on a windowsill to cool.  Benji lurches to the left, causing the leads to cross and twist and this trips up poor old Sukie. Whilst in the act of untwisting the leads, Crystal notices that Trixy has managed slip her collar, is running down the riverbank and is about to leap into the water after a family of ducks...

The number of dogs that Crystal manages to bring back to their owners in the condition they were entrusted to her care decides whether she can continue another day in her chosen profession.

The app makes use of stylised animated dogs in Augmented Reality, set in the real locale through coupling with Google API and Google Cloud Anchors. This simulates the experience of walking a bunch of very cute, very lively, but extremely distracted dogs!

A day in the life of the dog-walker. You couldn't make it up!
