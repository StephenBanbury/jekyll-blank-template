title: Create a Game - Dog Walker Simulator

## Brief:

>Sometimes average people are called to extraordinary measures. It happens all the time in movies, books and on television. Innumerable action movies pit people against one another and push them past the point where the 'common man or woman' become quite uncommon: Erin Brockovich is a classic example of such a person. 
For this activity, your task is to select a common man or woman in a normal job in a fairly average world: there is nothing that might cause you to think twice about them. To test this, ask yourself 'would I presently watch a movie that covered the last week in the life of this person?', if the answer is yes, then the odds are you do not find them common at all. Think of a common but not specific person you meet in your everyday life: a grocery-store employee; construction worker; bus driver; or cab / taxi driver. Any profession that is common will do. 
Now, think of how you could build a game based on the character's everyday life when it suddenly takes a dramatic turn. The situation changes suddenly and the person is forced to step up and go beyond what they thought was humanly possible. Luckily, they have your trusty app to give them extra superpowers. 

>**Deliverables:**

>A brief description of a common man or woman character (this could be based on some persona development).
Details of a realistic, inciting moment that makes the character uncommon. 
A non-digital game design, based on the character, that utilises your app as part of the gameplay to bestow superpowers upon the user. 

>**Suggested process:**

>* Pick a common profession and a common man or woman. Create a persona for them. 
* Determine what the inciting moment will be. It could be something like the death of a loved one and the desire for revenge (Max Payne) or as seemingly trivial as the race to fill seats and serve people at a restaurant (Diner Dash).
* Determine a type of game to build. What kind of core dynamics would suit the character and how would they use your app to save the day? 
* Create a deliverable.

## Dog Walker Simulator

Crystal is a dog-walker by profession. She has build a trusting client base over the past 5 years and, through the dogs, has made many friends - or at least that's how she likes to see them.

On this particular, unusual, day, the dogs seem to be behaving rather differently to the lovely calm creatures she has become used to. Fido, for some unfathomable reason, has decided to snap at Tia whenever she comes close. This is a problem, particularly as she is tethered to the lead next to Fido. Thankfully, the app on her phone, which shows the georgeous little pooches via glorious Augmented Reality, allows Crystal to move Tia to the other side of the pack. 

Unfortunately, this now means that Rusty is next to Fido, and Rusty seems to have picked up a severe case of unwelcome, itchy, leaping, guests (flees). These begin jumping from Rusty onto Fido's coat. Fido begins scratching, which causes the pack to swerve to the right! Luckily, the app allows Crystal to tug at the lead and bring Fido back into line. 

Meanwhile, Benji has picked up the odor of a freshly-cooked pie that has been left on a windowsill to cool.  Benji lurches to the left, causing the leads to cross and twist and this trips up poor old Sukie. Whilst in the act of untwisting the leads, Crystal notices that Trixy has managed slip her collar, is running down the riverbank and is about to leap into the water after a family of ducks...

The number of dogs that Crystal manages to bring back to their owners in the condition they were entrusted to her care decides whether she can continue another day in her chosen profession.

The app makes use of stylised animated dogs in Augmented Reality, set in the real locale through coupling with Google API and Google Cloud Anchors. This simulates the experience of walking a bunch of very cute, very lively, but extremely distracted dogs!

A day in the life of the dog-walker. You couldn't make it up!

I'm updating my idea to better fit the brief.

Crystal is out on one of her dog-walking excursions. She has five or six dogs each on a lead. As she begins to turn off the pavement alongside a busy road, a passing fire engine suddenly and unexpectedly turns on its very loud and piercing siren..

WEEE-OOOO-WEEE-OOOO.....

Startled, the dogs yank themselves free and run off, leads attached, into the park in various different directions! OMG!

Momentarily panicking, Crystal does not know what she is going to do, and thoughts turn to how on earth she is going to explain this to the owners when she returns without their darling doggies! 

But.. she remembers that the dogs have GPS devices attached to their leads and she has an app on her phone so they can be tracked. How very forward-thinking of her!

She starts up the app and within 30 seconds all dogs have been located on a Google map. She immediately starts off in the direction of Rusty, who appears to be heading towards a dangerous looking dual carriageway. She decides she'll come back for those that are more close-by as soon as Rusty is safe..

Deliverable

The app will use geofencing, with fences located on randomly moving points. The player must find the virtual pooches, by locating the moving geofences, before they are lost for good or, worse, they meet a sticky end or they get caught by the dog-warden! The dog characters are represented using Anime-cartoon-style graphics and a checklist is provided to tick off the dogs as they are brought back to safely.  

'Woof' if you think all the dogs can be found withing the time-limit!
