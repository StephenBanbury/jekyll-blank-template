# Synthesised speech used throught the game

Speech is used in order to attempt to connect and bond the player with the game and with the game's motives. 


Text taken from my introduction, or 'prologue' to the game, will be used. The question is, do I use it all at once, at the start, or would it be better to distribute it throughout the game at poignant moments?

>Welcome. Thank you for volunteering. We have a critical situation. There are a number of disasters that require your urgent attention.

>Your willingness to help is much appreciated. We are currently experiencing extremely high levels of disruption to everyday lives on a global scale. Current pressure ratings are at dangerous levels. We are relying on your calm efficiency, pragmatism and intelligence to help bring us back to within calm and sustainable levels. Are you willing to engage?

>These resources are precious. 

>Please assign them carefully to the disasters with which you are confronted. 

>Donâ€™t forget: be cool.
 
>Be careful. 

>Diligent planning will help more people.

>Too much attention to a single cause can mean failure for so many others.

>Good luck!



The text to speech service I have been using provides a satisfying balance between realistic and synthesised, where the voice is noticably unreal but also pleasant, calming and soothing in a very human way. Although very different in tone, it encompasses some of the character I wanted to emulate that is present in the wonderfully recongnisable and now ubiquitous standard for artificial intelligence that is the voice of **HAL 9000** in _**2001: A Space Odyssey**_.

My failed attempts to find a suitably similar speech synthesiser did not actually last very long. I did not want to use the exact same voice - it would be a little too derivative my taste and too denotive of something that I am not trying to re-create. But it was the character that I wanted to harness. I want to keep the player aware of their relationship with the game, to continue to let them know they are part of something that is not an actual and genuine attempt at a pretence to pass itself off as real, and this may be emphasised by the slightly separate and other-worldly nature of the immersive environment.
