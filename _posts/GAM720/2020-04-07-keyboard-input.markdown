## Attempts at finding a way to input player credentials in VR

This has proved to be not a simple as I'd expected. 

Standard input methods using Unity are not so easy to customise. That's not to say it can't be done, but unless you are a very experienced and knowledgable Unity / VR developer, it does not appear as anything close to a straightforward process.

It's possible I have missed something that ought to be obvious, but missed it I have.

I found some assets on the Unity App Store - the free options I could not get working. Again, it could be possible to work with these and perhaps I am being a little hasty in my dismissal of them, but I do not have a lot of time and, unless there is accompanying documentation or something comes up from a few Google searches or checking out YouTube tutorials, then my patience is stretched beyond breaking point. It's then time to move on to something else.

One that looked interesting was VR Keyboard, which uses [xylaphone-style mallets to hit the keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_kUlVTyRag).

However, I could not get this to work in my Oculus Quest setup. But then I found VRKB which is very similar, is newer (July 2019), has no reviews, no feedback anywhere. But it costs $10 - not a huge amount of money, but what if it does not work - it's money down the drain. But it does have [documentation](https://forum.unity.com/threads/released-vrkb-virtual-reality-keyboard.735905/) an accompanying [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=90&v=J1dHujWH23s&feature=emb_logo) in which the develop demonstrates how easy it is to set up. The video has no likes, no dislikes and no comments, which is a concern, but it exists and that counts for something!

I also found two other potential suiters in the asset store - $4.99 and $15 respectively. Like VRKB they do not specifically mention Oculus Quest, but I am tempted by them, in the order of cheapest first. They are more standard in their operation - the $4.99 one looks like it uses gazing predominantly, but has possibly been recently updated to use lazer pointing. But I do like the idea of those xylophone mallets... hmmm...

# An aside: this is very interesting

Not something for this project - far from it - but very interesting none the less.

[VR-OS: Keyboard and Mouse - Custom hardware and software implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFGweUpAs8I). I'm mentioning it purely for its fascination value - I would love to be in a position to play around with this kind of thing. It uses a physical setup, tracking hand movements as they interacting with a physical keyboard and trackable mouse, using this data in realtime in a VR environment. So there is no need to use a virtual keyboard/mouse or to remove the headset in order to use the physical objects. It's fun and practical. However, as Augmented Reality grows in use and potential, this kind of thing should become an interesting footnote in the onward march of virtual technology.



Went for VR UIKit. $35 including tax. More than just the keyboard - also includes other useful-looking UI snippets.


However, it's not as easy to set up as I'd hoped. But still a good learning curve continuation that will help in the long-haul.

Need laser for this: https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-utilities-for-unity-5/

But where is it? There is no Laser Input Module, as demonstrated in the video!
Look like it has been depricated.
