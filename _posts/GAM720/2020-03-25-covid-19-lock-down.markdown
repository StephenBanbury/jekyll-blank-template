## What gives?

So, we're all on government-inforced lock-down. Generally, this is already having a significant effect on everyday life, but how will it effect my MA development work and studies?

1. **I'm working from home**. This in itself is not a huge issue - it's something I've done regularly for many years, albeit not for every day of the week and for such a prolonged period is this is set to be. However, this is not working from home (WFH) under normal cicumstances due to the fact that...
2. **Schools are closed**. My elder, year-7, Key Stage 2 son is home from school and needs a certain amount of 'assistance' (or maybe coersion) with getting on with the limited quantity of available online schooling, and
3. **My younger son**, who is home-schooled on an ABA (Applied Behaviour Analysis) programme, **finds himself with no tutor** - one is self-isolating whilst the other is.. well, staying home. He is unable to be left to his own devices and requires full intensive interaction. 
4. **My lovely wife is also working from home**. Between us, we have quite a load. We will need to use some - hopefully not all- of our annual leave to keep son two's education going. Unfortunately, how I can find time for my usual once-per-week study day is not certain. Today, it was impossible. It's now nearly 8pm and I'm just getting going - unfortunately I'm further delayed by writing about these issues!
5. **Will the NEC Expo go ahead?** Apparently so, but it has been postponed to 7th-9th May 2021! That's right.. **2021!** So it doesn't really feel like it is postponed but, rather, cancelled for this year. 
6. **Will the 2020 Rotary Convention in Honolulu go ahead?** Nope - it's been cancelled.

At the moment, I'm thinking I will continue to build the app as though my deadline for a complete working version has not changed. Hopefully there will be further events this year and, in any case, whatever happens, it will be ready 'off-the-shelf' should it be required. I feel sure it will be - it's the 'when' that is uncertain right now.

# To pivot, or not to pivot. That is the question.

If I decide to take this tack, then I will be continuing to use this module as an extension of the last - GAM740 - which was all about working with a client in delivering a 'product' in response to a brief. I have been informed, of course, that this is absolutely fine with the university. However, what about all those Unity, Oculus, general VR and game development techniques that I'm still learning? I keep coming across new nuggets of game programming techniques or patterns that are new to me and I am itching to learn and put into practice.

**On the one hand**, I have been absolutely fine putting these tempting morsels to one side for the time being in order to ensure that a usable product is created in time for the looming deadline. I'll be able to come back to these, is the thinking. In fact, it's great that I'm stock-piling empty boxes and, although I know they will eventually need filling, at least I have an idea of the tasks that lies ahead.

**On the other hand**, this could now be a chance to start filling some of these boxes, whilst still aiming for a usable viable product. At the end of such a process, I will have increased my knowledge and ability to tackle problems in the future. However, this is set against the vagueness of the targetted final result in respect of the need to take a finished product off the peg, if required to do so, once this virus has been quashed and the world of expos and conventions is open once more for business.

**On the one hand**, I will be deciding to concentrate on game narrative and dynamics over game development techniques. For instance, how to progress a (the) game, make it interesting, consider issues of winning and losing - if this is actually necessary - or just seeing how far you can get as a player, with odds stacking up against you.

**On the other**, I will be improving my programming skills in relation to hard game development techniques. For example, what's a Lerp? How do Unity Vector3 transformations work, and why are they important (I know they are).  There's an absolutely huge amount I do not know about, let alone how to make use of. 

Of course, these two seemingly separate identifiable areas for targeting my efforts and concentration do actually go hand-in-hand. I suppose it may be more productive to concentrate on the game itself, as in what it sets out to achieve, and how, and then to work on the techniques as they are required in order to achieve these aims, in a kind of **form follows function** paradigm. The issue here is that I am not yet a master craftsman in this field.

But.. I will only really learn by responding to need. I therefore propose to avoid the temptation to pivot, but to continue to develop the game towards an ideal agreed between myself and ShelterBox.  In so doing, I will look to incorporate techniques that are new to me, if and wherever possible - I will not seek to take the easy path just because it is available to me. **Where I see more can be gained in the long-term through a litte hard work and an embracing of an experimental attitude, informed from the constraints and perspective of the brief, this is a path I will take.**
