## What gives?

So, we're all on government-inforced lock-down. Generally, this is already having a significant effect on everyday life, but how will it effect my MA development work and studies?

1. **I'm working from home**. This in itself is not a huge issue - it's something I've done regularly for many years, albeit not for every day of the week and for such a prolonged period is this is set to be. However, this is not working from home (WFH) under normal cicumstances due to the fact that...
2. **Schools are closed**. My elder, year 7 age son is home from school and needs a certain amount of 'assistance' (or maybe coersion) with getting on with the limited quantity of available online schooling, and
3. **My younger son**, who is home-schools on an ABA (Applied Behaviour Analysis) programme, **finds himself with no tutor** - one is self-isolating whilst the other is.. well, staying home. He is unable to be left to his own devices and requires full intensive interaction. 
4. **My lovely wife is also working from home**. Between us, we have quite a load. We will need to use some - hopefully not all- of our annual leave to keep son two's education going. Unfortunately, how I can find time for my usual once-per-week study day is not certain. Today, it was impossible. It's now nearly 8pm and I'm just getting going - unfortunately I'm further delayed by writing about these issues!
5. **Will the NEC Expo go ahead?** Apparently so, but it has been postponed to 7th-9th May 2021! That's right.. **2021!** So it doesn't really feel like it is postponed but, rather, cancelled for this year. 
6. **Will the 2020 Rotary Convention in Honolulu go ahead?** Nope - it's been cancelled.

At the moment, I'm thinking I will continue to build the app as though my deadline for a complete working version has not changed. Hopefully there will be further events this year and, in any case, whatever happens, it will be ready 'off-the-shelf' should it be required. I feel sure it will be - it's the 'when' that is uncertain right now.
