Considering past rapid ideation and prototyping ideas has thrown up another possibility. 
[The Odd Word Out]({% link _posts/GAM710/2019-02-25-week-three-appjam-2.markdown %}) was a simple idea that became an MVP, my intention being to pick it up later for further development. At the time I wrote: -

>There is significant potential for further development of the concept of arcade-style word games.

At the time I had not thought of this in terms of Virtual Reality, but the potential is there for this to be a fun word game with an educational slant. It would not necessarily lose its arcade-style appeal, although it would gain a sophistication that would be interesting to explore.

Instead of a 2D space I could have the words, maybe in the form of balls or other 3D objects, bouncing off walls, floors and ceilings within an immersive 3D space. It would the task of the player to knock out words by hurling related - or unrelated - words at them. 

Or it could, for instance, become a kind of shooting game where the principle of eliminating certain words remains, but the method is entirely different. 

There are many options
