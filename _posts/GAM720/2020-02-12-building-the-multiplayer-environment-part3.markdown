## STOP!!!

# Breaking News

I have agreed to continue the work I undertook for **[ShelterBox](https://www.shelterbox.org/)** during the last module - **GAM740: Live Brief Design and Development Project**. 

It is an honour, a priviledge and extrememly exciting to be able to move the VR prototypes I created for ShelterBox into the production phase. In doing so, it has been agreed with ShelterBox that I am free to use the project as the vehicle for the experimentations and investigations that are encouraged and expected as part of the GAM720 module.

However, amidst the delight of being asked to do this work, it is unfortunate that my plans to include multiplayer dynamics within my GAM720 project will need to be put on hold. The reason for this is that the project is to be shown at **[Volunteer Expo 2020](https://www.volunteerexpo.co.uk/)** at **NEC Birmingham**. The Exhibition Centre is not likely to provide WiFi of sufficient quality for multiplayer networking to take place. Unfortunate though this is, a practical solution appears beyond the constraints of the limited timeframe and available resources. 

I will, however, continue to explore the possibilities of multiplayer and social VR, particularly with educational aims in mind, and I hope to incorporate this work in the future - possibly my final MA project. 

Commencement: tomorrow!
