## STOP!!!

# Breaking News

**[ShelterBox](https://www.shelterbox.org/)** have asked if I'd be interested in continuing the work on the brief for _Conference Booth Games_ I undertook for them during the last module - **GAM740: Live Brief Design and Development Project**. This would be to move the VR prototypes I created for ShelterBox into the production phase. In doing so, it has been agreed with ShelterBox that I am free to use the project as the vehicle for the experimentations and investigations that are encouraged as part of the GAM720 module.

The intention is for the product to be shown at **[Volunteer Expo 2020](https://www.volunteerexpo.co.uk/)** at **NEC Birmingham**. 
Unfortunately, this will mean my plans to experiment with multiplayer dynamics within my GAM720 project will need to be put on hold. The reason for this is that the Exhibition Centre is unlikely to provide WiFi of sufficient quality for multiplayer networking to take place. A practical solution appears beyond the constraints of the limited timeframe and resources available. 

I will, however, continue to explore the possibilities of multiplayer and social VR, particularly with educational aims in mind, and I hope to incorporate this work in the future - possibly my final MA project.
