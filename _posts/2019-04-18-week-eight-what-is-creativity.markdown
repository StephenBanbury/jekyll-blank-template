This week’s subject is Creativity. The idea of bringing a truly creative approach to app development is, to me, an exciting one. In fact, the use of the word 'creative' in the title of this MA was, for me, probably the biggest draw, particularly seeing it used in conjunction with the words ‘app’ and ‘development’. At the time, when viewed in context of the plethora of computing courses positioned within the realm of the sciences, the bringing together of these words seemed unusual. But to me it seemed a perfectly natural fit. Perhaps the word 'app' conjures up something of the current zeitgeist, as the past decade has seen apps become a staple of a modern life, often in playful and entertaining ways. But, even aside from this kind of creative intent, I have long viewed coding _itself_ as an inherently creative process, and my growth as a programmer has occurred alongside my development as an artist.

## Disruption

The main thrust of this week’s lecture, by Prof. Tanya Krzywinska, introduces the analysis of _productive creativity_ as an academic discipline, examining how building a creative approach directly into the development process, at a fundamental level, and making apps that are exciting for their users, is itself highly effective in generating commercial leverage and monetising the product. In a crowded marketplace, creativity can make an app distinctive and set it apart from the mainstream.  Discussing the nature of creativity itself, Prof. Krzywinska highlights it as a source of ‘disruption’, of de-familiarisation, forcing us to see things differently. It makes things exciting and, consequently, it is a highly marketable commodity. 

In terms of the progression of my own ideas for app development, I intend to hold on to the thoughts and ideas generated by this lecture and to ensure I bring an approach to my own work that embraces them. The idea of risk and creativity going hand-in-hand, is one that I am very familiar with, as a music-creator (‘composer’ seems a little proscriptive of a particular type of music-creator) and artist. I started the course stating that I was interested in innovation and creativity within app development, and this way of thinking about and approaching the process of building apps chimes with my view of app development as being not dissimilar to any other kind of creative or artistic production.  Indeed, the term ‘creative industries’ is now fully accepted, and there appears to be an increasingly close relationship between commercial creative production, and the output produced within the creative app markets.

## Hooks and stickiness

As Prof. Tanya Krzywinska notes, many of the ‘hooks tactics’ that provide ‘stickiness’ to an app have been influenced by the strategies used by soap operas and long-running narratives like Game Of Thrones.  These hooks are used to engage viewers and hold their interest in order to continually bring them back to the show. In games, stickiness has mostly been generated through allowing the player to become more powerful or skilful, but the kind of episodic approach of the soap opera is increasingly being seen in games. This allows cost and risk to be evened out, for instance, by sales of _Episode 1_ paying for _Episode 2_, and so on. In so doing, a brand or franchise becomes more sustainable.

# The benefits to education

I am interested to note that, as suggested by Prof. Krzywinska, games are not purely about entertainment, but can also be powerful tools for learning; that the feedback that games can provide and the stickiness that keep players engaged can also be used to help learn new skills and to motivate users to do so. This has a particular resonance in terms of my own ideas for game-focused education apps, and I am encouraged to home in on these aspects and utilise them for the purpose of concentrating the learning process, whilst simultaneously enhancing the fun aspects of the learning experience.     

## Creating stickiness for the App Jam word game

My word game currently does just one thing. There is no means for progression or to develop the player’s powers. There is just one moment of jeopardy, where the game simply ends with either a ‘you win’ or ‘you lose’. I would like to build some ‘stickiness’ into the game in order for my players to want to continue to play and to come back to the game at a later date. I have created a SMART goal to test out ideas for hooks and to add stickiness: -

* **Make it Specific:** I would like to encourage the players of my App Jam word game to want to continue to play and to come back to it later, so my goal is to design hooks that will add stickiness to the game. 
* **Make it Measurable:** I would like to identify two hooks – one being of a ‘power-up’ type and the other a ‘game progression / episode’ type.
* **Make it Attainable:** This will be achieved over a single week.
* **Make it Relevant:** I will apply my hook features to my word game app.
* **Make it Time-Based:** I will use three sessions for this work – the first session will be to identify and conceptualise the hooks, the second session to prototype the first hook as a feature within the app and the third session to prototype the second hook.

## Summary

I have been excited by this week's content. Closing the gap between _creativity_ and _app development_ is one of the main reasons I am on the course. I am keen to start trying to develop a way of working that incorporates, at a fundamental level, a creative approach into the developmental process; one that instils a sense of risk-taking and discomfort, which I hope will add excitement to the end result. 

Following the Audience Research lecture and activities from [week seven]({% link _posts/2019-04-15-week-seven-audience-research.markdown %}) I am also looking forward to thinking about and developing hook structures that add interest and stickiness for my audience, that will encourage them to continue to participate, entice them to return and develop a loyalty to my brand.  In particular, in the case of my education game ideas, I hope that such techniques will aid the process of learning.
