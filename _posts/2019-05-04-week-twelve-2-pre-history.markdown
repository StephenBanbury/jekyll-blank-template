# On commencing the MA in Creative App Development...

# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not know exactly what path I was going to follow...

# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not have a well-formed idea of a destination...
<br>

I did know something about the new technologies driving the industry, of web development.. and beyond.. and wished to **know them all**: -

* real-time push capabilities provided by the advent of node.js
* client-powered single page websites
* native and cross-platform mobile development
* artificial intelligence
* machine learning
* cloud storage and related technologies
* Big Data
* Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality

**and so on...**  

**I felt the need to get to know more about these** – and still do – but I was not part of an environment in which I was easily able to do so. 

I also have no formal qualifications in the area of computers, software development, mathematics or science. Most of my colleagues seemed to come from one of these areas and I felt I would benefit from learning and solidifying my knowledge and skills, as well as providing a boost for my CV.

# My early years

My background, academically at least, is in the arts – particularly music – although I have always been interested in technology generally and computers specifically. I taught myself to code back in the early 80s through studying listings in magazines and trying simple ideas out on the ZX81 on display in my local WHSmiths. Progress continued on my ZX Spectrum and later a BBC Micro, which I regard as the greatest learning tool in history! 

Music played a massive part in my life growing up, but I appeared to be following a likely career path in software development, until a late and protracted period of uncertainty ended with me throwing my energy into the arts. Firstly, I studied A level art in night-class, followed by a foundation year at art college. I then moved into music, working in a recording studio, managing a jazz club, playing in bands and completing a BA (hons) in Music, specialising in Performance Technology. 

# My professional life

Since finishing my degree, I have found my computer-related hobby gradually increasing to become my profession, whilst my career in the arts has conversely become an impassioned hobby. Post-BA, I began work assessing small-scale funding applications for the Arts Council of England’s lottery-funded _Arts 4 Everyone_ scheme. During this time, I took on the administration of the scheme’s database, eventually moving fully into database development as a freelancer, the intention being to fund my main career as a creator of music and art. Over time, it became easier to find work as a developer than commissions as a composer, and the respective levels of remuneration caused the proportion of my time spent on these areas to increase in favour of development. 

# Here I am

In 2017, when I first saw the title of the this MA - _Creative App Development_ - I was immediately struck by the way the combination of these words seemed to encompass everything I wished to learn and achieve in my professional life; they instilled in me a deep-seated desire to somehow find a way on to the course. If I was not able to do so, at least I knew that such things exist. A spark had been ignited.

Luckily, with perfect timing, I was made redundant! I was given enough money by my former employer to fund my place on the MA and to tide me over for a while until I found my next day job; this I began exactly two weeks before I embarked on my new life as a Falmouth distance-learning MA student. I could not have been happier!
