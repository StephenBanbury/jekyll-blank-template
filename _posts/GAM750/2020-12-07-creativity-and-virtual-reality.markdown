**from abstract**

>"perhaps the safest, most fully developed of the emerging technologies of cognitive enhancement"

>"an underused tool for the enhancement of creativity"

>"researchers, educators, trainers, designers, managers, and others concerned with innovation should be more informed about virtual reality technologies (VRTs) both because of their widespread and growing accessibility and because of the significant, synergistic contributions they can make to human performance and understanding"

>"VRTs offer a cost-effective means of implementing and optimizing nearly all conventional individual and collaborative creativity enhancement techniques while also offering potent new possibilities and combinations not available by other means"

>"five ways VR can be used to enhance creativity and problem solving: (a) by changing aspects of the self and self-perception; (b) by optimizing interactions and collaboration with others; (c) by optimizing environmental conditions and influences; (d) by facilitating guidance or gamification of the problem-solving process; and (e) by offering an arena for the integration of other technologies of creativity enhancement such as pharmacological enhancement, brain stimulation, and neurofeedback."

***Paint with me: Stimulating creativity and empathy while painting with a painter in virtual reality*** (Gerry, 2017) discusses embodiment and collaboration resutling in empathy and hightened creative potential. These are aspects of VR that I believe are important to the success of NNE's interactive, creative environment. The abilty to put oneself in someone else's shoes, and to view the world from outside one's own reality, gives a different perspective that stimulates the senses and imagination.
