# Virtual reality and the enhancement of creativity and innovation
(Thornhill-Miller and Dupont, 2016)

[https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgrjcep/15/1/102](https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgrjcep/15/1/102)

**from abstract**

>"perhaps the safest, most fully developed of the emerging technologies of cognitive enhancement"

>"an underused tool for the enhancement of creativity"

>"researchers, educators, trainers, designers, managers, and others concerned with innovation should be more informed about virtual reality technologies (VRTs) both because of their widespread and growing accessibility and because of the significant, synergistic contributions they can make to human performance and understanding"

>"VRTs offer a cost-effective means of implementing and optimizing nearly all conventional individual and collaborative creativity enhancement techniques while also offering potent new possibilities and combinations not available by other means"

>"five ways VR can be used to enhance creativity and problem solving: (a) by changing aspects of the self and self-perception; (b) by optimizing interactions and collaboration with others; (c) by optimizing environmental conditions and influences; (d) by facilitating guidance or gamification of the problem-solving process; and (e) by offering an arena for the integration of other technologies of creativity enhancement such as pharmacological enhancement, brain stimulation, and neurofeedback."

# Paint with me: Stimulating creativity and empathy while painting with a painter in virtual reality 
(Gerry, 2017)

Discusses embodiment and collaboration resulting in empathy and hightened creative potential. These are aspects of VR that I believe are important to the success of NNE's interactive, creative environment. The abilty to put oneself in someone else's shoes, and to view the world from outside one's own reality, gives a different perspective that stimulates the senses and imagination. (see **[embodiment in virtual reality]({% link _posts/GAM750/2020-12-05-embodiment-in-virtual-reality.markdown %})**).

# Learning in virtual reality: Effects on performance, emotion and engagement
(Allcoat and von Mühlenen, 2018)

This study appears to show clear advantages of VR over other mediums for learning. 

From abstract:
>Recent advances in virtual reality (VR) technology allow for potential learning and education applications. For this study, 99 participants were assigned to one of three learning conditions: traditional (textbook style), VR and video (a passive control). The learning materials used the same text and 3D model for all conditions. Each participant was given a knowledge test before and after learning. Participants in the traditional and VR conditions had **improved overall performance** (i.e. learning, including knowledge acquisition and understanding) compared to those in the video condition. Participants in the VR condition also showed **better performance for ‘remembering’** than those in the traditional and the video conditions. Emotion self-ratings before and after the learning phase showed an **increase in positive emotions and a decrease in negative emotions** for the VR condition. Conversely there was a decrease in positive emotions in both the traditional and video conditions. The Web-based learning tools evaluation scale also found that participants in the VR condition **reported higher engagement** than those in the other conditions. Overall, VR displayed an **improved learning experience** when compared to traditional and video learning methods.

# Being There in the Midst of the Story: How Immersive Journalism Affects Our Perceptions and Cognitions
(Sundar et al, 2017)

Specifically relating to journalism, but the similarity and comparison of the response to theatrical 'story-telling' is fairly clear. 

>Immersive journalism in the form of virtual reality (VR) headsets and 360°-video is becoming more mainstream and is much touted for **inducing greater “presence”** than traditional text. But, does this presence influence psychological outcomes of reading news, such as memory for story content, perceptions of credibility, and empathy felt toward story characters? We propose that **two key technological affordances of VR (modality and interactivity) are responsible for triggering three presence-related cognitive heuristics (being-there, interaction, and realism), which influence news readers' memory and their perceptions of credibility, empathy, and story-sharing intentions**. We report a 3 (storytelling medium: VR vs. 360°-video vs. Text) × 2 (story: “The displaced” and “The click effect”) mixed-factorial experiment, in which participants (N = 129) experienced two New York Times stories (that differed in their emotional intensity) using one of three mediums (VR, 360°-video, Text). Participants who experienced the stories using VR and 360°-video **outperformed those who read the same stories using text with pictures, not only on such presence-related outcomes as being-there, interaction, and realism, but also on perceived source credibility, story-sharing intention, and feelings of empathy**. Moreover, we found that **senses of being-there, interaction, and realism mediated the relationship between storytelling medium and reader perceptions of credibility, story recall, and story-sharing intention**. These findings have **theoretical implications for the psychology of virtual reality**, and practical applications for immersive journalism in particular and interactive media in general.

# Reasons to use virtual reality in education and training courses and a model to determine when to use virtual reality
(Pantelidis, 2010)

This paper discusses a significant number of studies that demonstrate the use and advantages of VR in an education environment. As a tool for learning, VR appears to display many useful traits. 

>Studies show that a virtual environment can “stimulate learning and comprehension, because it provides a tight coupling between symbolic and experiential information” (Bowman, Hodges, Allison, & Wineman, 1998)

>Numerous studies have focused on how children and young learners interact and learn in a 3D environment

>potential of spatial and social technologies in a virtual learning environment (VLE) through presence
