title: Syncing Data In Normcore
published: true
---

I'm setting out here to try to solve the problem of syncing abstract data between two instances in a multiplayer environment. 

The Normcore pattern of keeping gameobjects in sync with a model held in the datastore should, in theory, also work for simple values. Here I'm attempting to find out how to do this.

I'm looking in particular at the tutorial **[Synchronizing your own data with custom Realtime Components](https://normcore.io/documentation/guides/synchronizing-your-own-data.html)** here for some guidance. 

**You see the problem...**
