# The Challenges

This is a distributed multiplayer system. 

Communicate the complexity of the system as a whole.

This is a complex experiment, where I drop research and practice together. 

The outlier, the interest -  for some absurd reason I tried to fit VR around theatre. Attempting to rebuild some of the concepts and models that exist in theatre, in VR.

The request was to build something that already exists physically, in VR. It is safer to the theatre makers to do this. But perhaps this will open up opportunities for them to consider bringing the technology to the theatre makers, allowing them to embrace alternative modes of performance and of theatre environmental control. In a sense I have been a guide, showing them the potential. The hope is that they will see the potential of VR environments for what they can bring in their own right.
