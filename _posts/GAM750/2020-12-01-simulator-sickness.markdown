# Beyond Feeling Sick: The Visual and Cognitive Aftereffects of Virtual Reality

_Szpak, A., Michalski, S.C., Saredakis, D., Chen, C.S. and Loetscher, T., 2019. Beyond feeling sick: The visual and cognitive aftereffects of virtual reality. IEEE Access, 7, pp.130883-130892._

The authors of this study investigate _'visual and cognitive aftereffects of using HMDs and their relationship to the reporting of sickness'_, concentrating on two areas: _'Visual (accommodation and vergence) and cognitive (reaction time and rapid visual processing)'_


>Despite continued improvements in virtual reality (VR) technologies, many people still experience adverse symptoms from using head-mounted displays (HMDs)

It has been noted by this study that there are discernable aftereffects from engagin in a VR experience: 

>Cognitive effects include changes in decision times that may be related to alertness and attention

It is aslo noted that this is a relatively recent area of study. Personally, I am slightly surprised that the authors are surprised, seeing that VR itself is a relatively new development - in particular, as a popular form of entertainment. Most work until recently has been concentrated on the development of the technology, rather than its potential limitations. It may be that the warnings that have been placed by manufacturers on commercial VR devices are there to 'cover' themselves - perhaps they know that there may be some kind of effect, but do not yet understand what that effect is.

>Despite the recent popularity of HMDs, it is surprising that little is known about the visual and cognitive aftereffects of using VR in HMDs. Particularly, given that most if not all commercial VR devices come with safety warnings and list of visual and cognitive symptoms a user may experience during or post-exposure to VR content

# Vergence–accommodation conflicts hinder visual performance and cause visual fatigue

_Hoffman, D.M., Girshick, A.R., Akeley, K. and Banks, M.S., 2008. Vergence–accommodation conflicts hinder visual performance and cause visual fatigue. Journal of vision, 8(3), pp.33-33._

The title of this paper probably says it all!

>Unfortunately, 3D displays often yield distortions in perceived 3D structure compared with the percepts of the real scenes the displays depict. A likely cause of such distortions is the fact that computer displays present images on one surface. Thus, focus cues—accommodation and blur in the retinal image—specify the depth of the display rather than the depths in the depicted scene. Additionally, the uncoupling of vergence and accommodation required by 3D displays frequently reduces one's ability to fuse the binocular stimulus and causes discomfort and fatigue for the viewer.

# Virtual reality games on accommodation and convergence

_Elias, Z.M., Batumalai, U.M. and Azmi, A.N.H., 2019. Virtual reality games on accommodation and convergence. Applied ergonomics, 81, p.102879._

>Increasing popularity of virtual reality (VR) gaming is causing increased concern, as prolonged use induces visual adaptation effects which disturbs normal vision. Effects of VR gaming on accommodation and convergence of young adults by measuring accommodative response and phoria before and after experiencing virtual reality were measured. An increase in accommodative response and a decrease in convergence was observed after immersion in VR games. It was found that visual symptoms were apparent among the subjects post VR exposure.

# Developing visual systems and exposure to virtual reality and stereo displays: some concerns and speculations about the demands on accommodation and vergence

_Rushton, S.K. and Riddell, P.M., 1999. Developing visual systems and exposure to virtual reality and stereo displays: some concerns and speculations about the demands on accommodation and vergence. Applied Ergonomics, 30(1), pp.69-78._

>There is, however, some indication that long-term VR viewing
in adults can lead to visual problems. It seems important to determine the safety of these systems for the developing human visual
system before they come into common use

**... this was 1998!**

>The vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC) remains a major problem in head-mounted displays for virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR).
