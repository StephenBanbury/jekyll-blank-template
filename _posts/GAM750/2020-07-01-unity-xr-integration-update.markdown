# Update: I intend to persevere with XR Integration

**.. at least, for now.**

* I like the simplicity of the approach. Oculus SDK is somewhat 'noodly', requiring many different configurations and components depending on the specific scenario and associated setup. Unity XR appears to be more streamlined in this respect.

* XR will be much more future-proof, with Unity intending on deprecating support for Oculus SDK at some point in the future.

* As XR developes over time, my knowledge and understanding will grow with it. I will not need to start at the bottom of a steep learning curve when the target point is fast disappearing over the horizon. I will, hopefully, be within sight of that point throughout the journey.
  
* Hand tracking will be incoporated at some point. At the moment I don't believe I will require it, but I know I will in the future. If I find I need it sooner rather than later, then I can always revert to the Oculus SDK.
