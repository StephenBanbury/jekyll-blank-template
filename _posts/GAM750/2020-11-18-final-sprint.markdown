# Approaching the final straight

It seems very recently that this project began, but we are now coming close to the point where the students will be rehearsing for their final performances.

Confirmed during meeting with stakeholders 17/11/2020: -

* Rehearsals begin **7 December 2020**
* Performances **11 December 2020**
  
My own personal deadline for **Final Summative Project Submission** for the Masters Degree is **14 December 2020**. 


This equates to just less than three weeks to start of rehearsals. Before this point, the main items to do are: -

1. Turn off ability to transform each scene apart from _Scene 1_. I suggested abiltiy to enable this ability and to default to only _Scene 1_. This was agreed.
2. Identify each joining stream on the instantiated select button, to prevent ambiguity when selecting.
3. Separate controller for Stage Manager. This can be a development of the OSC controller I created earlier, and will allow fine control of all aspects of the environment.
4. A _Final Scene_, which will be a single video projected all around the audience - so probably a 360degree video space.
5. Finish of the video download capability
6. Doors working as portals for teleporting, with visual representation to indicate a screen is a portal

The most demanding, or potentially problematic, will probably be identification of joining streams (2), followed by the controller (3), then the final scene (4) and the simple can-transform toggle is quite straighforward.

I intend to do (1) first as it is very simple, before looking at identifying incomimg video streams (2). I will then add the ability for screens to act as portals for teleporting (6), before turing my attention to building the OSC (or equivalent) controller (3). I will finish off with the final scene (4). Concurrent to all of this, I will be working on the lobby (5), which is primarily a space to wait while assets are downloaded etc.

I have no doubt that there will be some technical issues along the way to deal with -  I am particularly concerned about ensuring the video streaming is working correctly. 

I also hope to build the performer video-streaming app for _Apple Mac_ and for _Android_ phone - this has been requested.
