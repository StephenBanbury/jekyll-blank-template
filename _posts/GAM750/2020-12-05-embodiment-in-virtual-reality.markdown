# Inducing illusory ownership of a virtual body

https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.01.029.2009/full

*Slater, M., Pérez Marcos, D., Ehrsson, H. and Sanchez-Vives, M.V., 2009. Inducing illusory ownership of a virtual body. Frontiers in neuroscience, 3, p.29.*

>Virtual reality additionally provides power to investigate these illusions at the whole body level. In Figure 2 we show an example of what can be seen when someone wears a tracked head-mounted display, **looks down, and sees a virtual body in place of their real one**. The very act of looking down, changing head orientation in order to gaze in a certain direction, with the visual images changing as they would in reality is already a powerful clue that you are located in the virtual place that you perceive. We argue elsewhere that multisensory contingencies that correspond approximately to those employed to perceive physical reality provide a necessary condition for the illusion of being in the virtual place (Slater 2009 ). Now imagine that you move, and the virtual body moves in correspondence with your movements, or you see something touch your virtual body and you feel the touch in the corresponding location in your real body. These events add significantly to the reality of what is being perceived – **not only are you in the virtual place, but you also have the illusion that the events occurring are real – therefore increasing the likelihood that you would respond realistically to virtual events and situations**.

>This realisation is important for the development of virtual reality applications because it means that one is not restricted to ultra-realistic simulations and high definition visual displays.

# The Audience Avatar

The creation of the audience’s avatars did not elicit much developmental time. However, this is a subject area that deserves more thought – and it will do so as the project continues.  Interestingly, this subject was picked up quite early on by the students. Somehow, a sense of individual identity is a property that is desired but currently lacking. Virtual social media has recently placed emphasis on the individuality of the avatar, but perhaps this aspect gets in the way of experiencing the performance itself, as the main attraction.  I have certainly felt this to be the case when attending viewings of performances in such social media platforms as AltspaceVr and VRChat.

# Are We Already Living in Virtual Reality?

_A new technology — virtual embodiment — challenges our understanding of who and what we are._

_Rothman, J., 2018. Are we already living in virtual reality. The New Yorker._

[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/02/are-we-already-living-in-virtual-reality](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/02/are-we-already-living-in-virtual-reality)

This is a very interesting read. 

>“On some level, the brain doesn’t know the difference between real reality and virtual reality. And a character on a 2-D screen is completely different from one that’s your height and looks you in the eye.”

>With a team of various collaborators, Slater and Sanchez-Vives have created many other-body simulations; they show how inhabiting a new virtual body can produce meaningful psychological shifts. In one study, participants are re-embodied as a little girl. Surrounded by a stuffed bear, a rocking horse, and other toys, they watch as their mother sternly demands a cleaner room. Afterward, on psychological tests, they associate themselves with more childlike characteristics. (When I tried it, under the supervision of the V.R. researcher Domna Banakou, I was astonished by my small size, and by the intimidating, Olympian height from which the mother addressed me.) In another, white participants spend around ten minutes in the body of a virtual black person, learning Tai Chi. Afterward, their scores on a test designed to reveal unconscious racial bias shift significantly. “These effects happen fast, and seem to last,” Slater said. A week later, the white participants still had less racist attitudes. (The racial-bias results have been replicated several times in Barcelona, and also by a second team, in London.) Embodied simulations seem to slip beneath the cognitive threshold, affecting the associative, unconscious parts of the mind. “It’s directly experiential,” Slater said. “It’s not ‘I know.’ It’s ‘I am.’ ”

# How we experience immersive virtual environments: the concept of presence and its measurement

_Slater, M., Lotto, B., Arnold, M.M. and Sanchez-Vives, M.V., 2009. How we experience immersive virtual environments: the concept of presence and its measurement. Anuario de psicología, 40(2), pp.193-210._

**Slater and Sanchez-Vives** - these two researchers (who happen to be married) have produced a number of papers that are worth, at the very least, a cursory reading. 

Terms to be researched: out-of-body experiences, body ownership, body transfer illusion.

**NB**: Emphasis my own
  
>In a review of the concept of presence in virtual environments and associated literature (Sanchez-Vives & Slater, 2005) it was reported that experimental studies have found that **factors that contribute to high reported presence are mainly concerned with the form of how data is displayed to participants and how they are able to interact, rather than with the level of realism of the displays**. For example, wide field of view, low latency, high frame-rate, surround sound, haptic feedback, stereo rather than mono displays, head-tracking all seem to contribute to higher reported presence. In addition the ability to interact with the environment making use of whole body interaction in a natural way appears to favour higher reported presence in comparison with “button-press” types of interaction more suited to two-dimensional displays. **What does not seem to be important is high fidelity visual realism**. For example, a person giving a talk in an immersive virtual environment to an audience of virtual characters who appear to be responding to the talk is likely to react to the behaviour of the virtual characters as if they were real –in spite of the absolute knowledge that there is no audience there, and in spite of the low level of realism of the characters (Pertaub et al., 2002).

# The Sense of Embodiment in Virtual Reality

[https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/PRES_a_00124](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/PRES_a_00124)

_Kilteni, K., Groten, R. and Slater, M., 2012. The sense of embodiment in virtual reality. Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 21(4), pp.373-387._

**Abstract**

>What does it feel like to own, to control, and to be inside a body? The multidimensional nature of this experience together with the continuous presence of one's biological body, render both theoretical and experimental approaches problematic. Nevertheless, exploitation of immersive virtual reality has allowed a reframing of this question to whether it is possible to experience the same sensations towards a virtual body inside an immersive virtual environment as toward the biological body, and if so, to what extent. The current paper addresses these issues by referring to the Sense of Embodiment (SoE). Due to the conceptual confusion around this sense, we provide a working definition which states that SoE consists of three subcomponents: the sense of self-location, the sense of agency, and the sense of body ownership. Under this proposed structure, measures and experimental manipulations reported in the literature are reviewed and related challenges are outlined. Finally, future experimental studies are proposed to overcome those challenges, toward deepening the concept of SoE and enhancing it in virtual applications.


This is not accessible without payment, but the three main 'subcomponents' are worth considering and exploring: - 

* the sense of self-location 
* the sense of agency
* the sense of body ownership

# How Immersive Is Enough? A Meta-analysis of the Effect of Immersive Technology on User Presence

**from abstract**

>The concept of presence, or “being there” is a frequently emphasized factor in immersive mediated environments. It is often assumed that greater levels of immersive quality elicit higher levels of presence, in turn enhancing the effectiveness of a mediated experience...
>results show that increased levels of user-tracking, the use of stereoscopic visuals, and wider fields of view of visual displays are significantly more impactful than improvements to most other immersive system features, including quality of visual and auditory content

# Paint with me: Stimulating creativity and empathy while painting with a painter in virtual reality

_Gerry, L.J., 2017. Paint with me: Stimulating creativity and empathy while painting with a painter in virtual reality. IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics, 23(4), pp.1418-1426._

>"On March 25, 2014, Facebook CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook had purchased Oculus VR, the leader in virtual reality technology. In his announcement, Zuckerberg suggests that virtual reality will be the new platform for social media, enabling a more personal and immersive exchange of experiences. Marc Andreessen, an Oculus VR angel investor, proclaims that the Oculus will “redefine fundamental human experiences.” (Oculus Blog, December 13, 2013) "

>"Termed “embodied experiences” (Ahn, Le, & Bailenson, 2015) or “embodied simulations (Bertrand, Franco, Pointeau, & Cherene, 2014), immersive virtual environment technology (IVET) can allow users to embody the first-person point-of-view of another person while seeing and hearing sounds from the experiential locus of another person, as though the viewer can wear another person's sensory apparatus. This simulation allows for the illusion of being in another person's shoes and embodying their perspective, a situation perhaps best represented by Spike Jonze's 2006 film Being John Malkovich, wherein characters enter a portal that allows them to see, feel, and hear through John Malkovich's body. Because this new communication medium allows people to share a new mode of access one another's experiences, this study hypothesizes that it can facilitate greater intimacy, understanding, and empathy."

>In the opening quote, David Foster Wallace summarizes one of the greatest obstacles of human communication: the attempt to translate the felt immediacy of first-person experience to someone else, and to moreover understand someone else's experience. Wallace states that all of our experiences are rendered through an embodied point of view, and that this orientation places the subject at the center of his or her experiences. However, recent advances in filmed, streamed, and simulated virtual reality environments allow subjects to see **first-personally from the point-of-view of another person, character, or avatar. Thus, in this sense, it could be argued that through this technology it is now possible to have exactly the type of experience that Wallace suggests our day-to-day mode of being occludes: an experience in which a person is not the absolute center of their own experience. Instead, through this technology the individual is placed in the center of someone else's experience**. This inductive study explores how this virtual simulation can transform our ability to relate to and learn from one another.


**My thoughts: -**

>"one of the greatest obstacles of human communication: the attempt to translate the felt immediacy of first-person experience to someone else, and to moreover understand someone else's experience"... "all of our experiences are rendered through an embodied point of view, and that this orientation places the subject at the center of his or her experiences"

The experience of the 'player' in the mutlplayer environment can not be completely replicated and expererienced in exactly the same way, but it is important to at least replicate the environment as near to exactly for all participants. It is then possible to share the player-manipulations of this environment, so as to share in the experience, and some form of common language in order to describe the experience. This became a hugely important factor when ensuring that, not only each player within the space experienced everything exactly the same as any other, but also, those who are responsible for manipulating the space and, therefore, the experience of those within the space, should not be removed any degree more than is absolutely necessary. The controller, as designed, therefore, is an attempt to allow exertion of control and manipulation, but at the same time, removing, or at least reducing, the distance and potential separation, between stage management, performer, and audience. 

Here, we are not 'just' experiencing someone else's experience,  this is our own experience, experienced for ourselves. Yet, perhaps, it is the inexcapable distance held between the player and their avatar, within the virtual space, that allows a degree of consideration and contemplation of the particular cicumstances of that 'other' entity, which would otherwise be difficult to separate from first-person experience, that allows a degree of objectivity to come into play in an area where the subjectivity of the first person would normally cloud any potential, deep understanding of a potential connection between the player and their environment.

I don't know, perhaps this is over-thought and overblown. But we are certainly finding ourselves in a place where worlds can be created and experienced at first-hand, as an individual inseperably part of them, able to interact and affect them, but yet also emphasising one's removal from the real physical world that allows us to breath, eat, flurish and also to fall ill, starve, suffocate and die. Evocations of empathy and a creative, collaborative response to these virtual surroundings, is not difficult to imagine. In fact, imagination is all but provided for and stiumulated, in much the same way that it would be in any 'immersive' environment. Perhaps the main difference here is that of 'agency', the ability to make changes and to be involved in the creation, to varying levels, of the environment itself. 

**The distance between the placement and experience of the user's avatar and the somewhat contrived and artificial situation in which they find themselves, unexpectedly provides a sense of hightened reality; perhaps this is because the limited control afforded and the resulting sense of helplessness combine to emphasise feelings of vulnerability; and vulnerability makes one somehow feel 'alive'.**

Virtual social media has recently placed emphasis on the individuality of the avatar, but perhaps this aspect gets in the way of experiencing the performance itself, as the main attraction.  I have certainly felt this to be the case when attending viewings of performances in such social media platforms as AltspaceVr and VRChat.

# Reflecting on the ShelterBox project

Empathy is a condition that I explored in my previous project - a gamified simulation of preparing and deploying overseas disaster-releaf aid for the charity, ShelterBox. The idea of seeing something from someone else's perspective, experiencing and sharing problems they encounter in their own specific situation, can invoke and enhance feelings of empathy.
