This is an option I had not come across when researching multiplayer environment options back in GAM720. Most information I have found this time around seems to be quite recent, even though it appears to have originally come into being in 2016. This, to me, is a good sign, as it appears to be gaining traction and becoming more relevant as time marches on. 

# Benefits
* Open source
* Free
* No player limits
* Good documentation
* Built on the old Unity multiplayer system (UNET), bug-fixed and generally improved.
* Client/Server pattern: the server can be hosted by a 'player, who is also a client (similar to Photon)
* You can also set up a dedicated server.
