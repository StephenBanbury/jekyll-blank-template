title: What Else Is There Out There?

# Here I am going to explore existing apps, experiences, games... basically anything whatsoever... that holds some level of interest as an immersive, interactive space for performance, socialisaing, creating.. basically, just 'being' in a virtual space with other 'people' represented in virtual form.

Firstly, it is probably worth saying that there is nothing else exactly like Not Near Enough. 

However, there is a clear and growing interest in breaking out of traditional theatre venue and exploring new ways of approaching storytelling and audience involvement, as evidenced by events like the Future of Storytelling Summit, the Sundance Film Festival’s New Frontier and Raindance Film Festival’s Immersive Stories.

Some recent developments attempt to bring the experience of attending an actual live performance to the individual in their own home. The resulting experience is much like watching a movie. Content from Digital Theatre (www.digitaltheatre.com) and National Theatre Live fall into this category. On-demand content from LIVR does a similar thing but the individual is placed in the centre of a 360 degree virtual reality theatre using a VR headset. 

However, these examples do not fit the bill if theatre is to be considered as a shared, communal experience. One of the great pleasures of theatre is experiencing it as part of an audience. The Under Presents is an immersive hybrid between theatre and game, for Oculus headsets, created by the art/games studio, Tender Claws. Their most recent production, The Tempest, was an interactive theatre experience. Relying heavily upon audience participation, the players were immersed as part of the performance itself, from actors to stagehands. As such it is a fascinating insight into the possibilities of VR storytelling. 

In this work, it is possible glimpse the potential of the platform we are creating with Not Near Enough, particularly in the way we are attempting to create a space where audience, actors, stage crew and management can come together, interact and each participate in the creation of the immersive experience. But we are also providing a stage where performers and stage managers can straddle the space between virtual and physical.
