Sometimes, no matter how one tries to adhere to the on-going march of the rolling sprint process, where tasks have been planned and set out for attention in a rational and (hopefully) realistic fashion, a requirement comes in from the client/stakeholder that needs to be given full attention as a matter of urgency or, at least, as something that has been newly added to the backlog with the highest priority possible, meaning it trumps all other tasks in the _'In Progress'_ column.

# Continual testing 

One could argue that these could have been thought of earlier in the planning process and, although there may be some truth in this, this is not always realistic. In any case, the fact that this pushes the iterative and immediacy of agile, only goes to highlight agile's ability to be iterative and immediate!  But this also highlights a benefit of **continual testing** during development. Again, normally one would add the results of testing to the task list for the next sprint, but sometimes this is trumped by the **immediate needs of the client**. In this case, it is because the product is being used in a real and practical sense by the students, as part of the process of development, and time is against them as much as it is against the developer!

# Requests turned around in no time

This morning I received a request for: -

1. numbers above the screens to help students with their selections and avoid a sense of randomness
2. video displays to be turned 90 degrees, in an attempt to prevent the elongation resulting from the video clips being stretched in order to fit the tall screen displays. The idea is that if they are tilted on their side, live and recorded content can be done with the freedom to also tilt cameras and videa can then be 'projected' onto the screens with the tilt corrected. I have yet to be convinced this will work!

These two requests were actioned very quickly and added to the release of the latest build, which contains the multispace, video streaming and screen trigger work done over the past week. If nothing else, **turning things around quickly helps with the building of trust between developer and stakeholder**.
