# I had an interesting experience today... 

**Not for the first time...**

I posted on the Discord channel about it: 

> I went into my VR space today for work, as I do, and the director was in there  having a look around. It's really interesting - there is a lot of talk of VR social media, but not a lot (I think) of direct 1-to-1 conversation in VR. It felt so natural, and surreal, to find myself in the space I've been creating and just randomly bumping into someone who I could see, shake hands with, have a chat with and throw a ball around. It's the phone of the future. Who needs VR social media and mixing with total strangers? If everyone has a headset then we can all call round for a coffee, a chat and a game of tiddlewinks whenever we like, with our closest mates or just about anyone. I think this is where we'll all end up - lying in bed while chatting with a mate we've never met in the flesh, drinking Earl Grey and playing backgammon while hanging out, equally comfortable in a totally fictitious place as on the top of Everest.

It may be a bit idealistic, and it came out of a frivolous and playful, albeit short and unexpected, moment. But that is also the point! Why not? The internet is the phone of the future. The mobile divice is one means to make the internet the phone of the future. VR takes this a step further. 

Fun though it can be, whereas there is a lot of excitement and movement in the world of social media towards the use of VR for hanging out much as you might do in a party, hoping to meet some stranger, perhaps making friends for life or experiencing a brief and (hopefully) passing acquaintence, there seems to be little catering for what I just experienced - that is, simply the potential for settling down for a chat with someone you know - in real, or virtual, life (in this case, I really have never met them in the flesh). 

# Feedback Immediacy

This was a great way to get some immediate feedback from a primary stakeholder. Watching him use the space, taking in the updates for the first time, and discussing his thoughts with me having had no time to ponder or to frame them. As a supplimentary form of feedback and user-testing, this is very interesting and very useful.

I had the same experience when accidentally stumbling upon a bunch of around five students experiencing the VR space for the first time. The response was unforgettable - the excitement was palpable, and as a suppliment to the more formal feedback gained from the students, is very interesting and informative.
