# The screen is now a 'button'

When the player's hand touches the screen, one of two actions happen, randomly: -

1. A randomly selected video clip plays
2. An animation occurs into a new randomly selected screen formation

This can be fairly startling, particularly the sudden change to screen formation, even more so when uninitiated and unexpected.

The number and type of different actions can be added to as development continues.

One idea would be to have some control of which of the actions happens, for example, by specific screen or by specific players. The latter would require identification of individual players, or of _'type'_ of player, in the first place - again, something that can be added in a future development.
