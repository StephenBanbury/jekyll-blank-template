The virtuality continuum is a continuous scale ranging between the completely virtual, a virtuality, and the completely real, reality.

In 1994 Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino defined a mixed reality as "...anywhere between the extrema of the virtuality continuum", where the Virtuality Continuum extends from the completely real through to the completely virtual environment with augmented reality and augmented virtuality ranging between.


>This paper focuses on Mixed Reality (MR) visual displays, a particular subset of Virtual Reality (VR) related technologies that involve the merging of real and virtual worlds somewhere along the _"virtuality continuum"_ which connects completely real environments to completely virtual ones. Probably the best known of these is Augmented Reality (AR), which refers to all cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are identified. However, an attempt to distinguish these classes on the basis of whether they are primarily video or computer graphics based, whether the real world is viewed directly or via some electronic display medium, whether the viewer is intended to feel part of the world or on the outside looking in, and whether or not the scale of the display is intended to map orthoscopically onto the real world leads to quite different groupings among the six identified classes, thereby demonstrating the need for an efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which essential differences can be identified. The 'obvious' distinction between the terms _"real"_ and _"virtual"_ is shown to have a number of different aspects, depending on whether one is dealing with real or virtual objects, real or virtual images, and direct or non-direct viewing of these. An (approximately) three dimensional taxonomy is proposed, comprising the following dimensions: Extent of World Knowledge (_"how much do we know about the world being displayed?"_), Reproduction Fidelity (_"how 'realistically' are we able to display it?"_), and Extent of Presence Metaphor (_"what is the extent of the illusion that the observer is present within that world?"_).

>The conventionally held view of a Virtual Reality (VR) environment is one in which the participant-observer is totally immersed in, and able to interact with, a completely synthetic world. Such a world may mimic the properties of some real-world environments, either existing or fictional; however, it can also exceed the bounds of physical reality by creating a world in which the physical laws ordinarily governing space, time, mechanics, material properties, etc. no longer hold. What may be overlooked in this view, however, is that the VR label is also frequently used in association with a variety of other environments, to which total immersion and complete synthesis do not necessarily pertain, but which fall somewhere along a virtuality continuum. In this paper we focus on a particular subclass of VR related technologies that involve the merging of real and virtual worlds, which we refer to generically as Mixed Reality (MR).

**The approach taken with the Not Near Enough project** plays with notions and ideas that are expressed within discussions surrounding the concept of a reality-virtuality continuum. This big *'playground'* we have been creating attempts to break down the continuum, or to link up parts of the continuum. We have video streaming and audio streaming coming into the VR. This plays with the boundaries between virtual reality and reality and the ways they connect; the boundaries between *our* realities and the *'realities'* of theatre. 

The NNE audience is placed in a space created as virtual reality. Taking Milgram's idea of the converse case of *Augmented Reality (AR)* on the virtuality continuum being *Augmented Virtuality (AV)*, there appears to be a correlation with the way in which the NNE virtual theatre space is augmented by live (as well as pre-prepared) video and audio feeds brought in from the world *outside* the virtual world. 

The real-time interactions that take place between real and the virtual can be represented by interactions between points on the continuum, as can notions of the different modes of control: *internal* and *external*, *intrinsic* and *extrinsic*; control over the mechanics of the virtual objects and over how media is displayed from external sources, can be exerted both from within the virtual space and external to it. The experimentation with OSC takes this further, by providing the potential for standard theatre contol equipment to effect change within the virtual space.

The relationships between performers, audience and stage managers, in terms of not only their differing roles, but also their positioning and nature of their interactions within and across the continuum, is also interesting. 
* What motivates the audience compared with what motivates the performers? 
* How do limitations and affordances affect motivation? 
* How does witnessing and experiencing other points on the continuum, from the perspective of their own, affect this? Is it a little like being aware of the concept of a fourth dimension, and having the ability to imagine it, when reality dictates that one only has access to three dimentions?

**It is interesting that theatre is already a kind of virtual way of viewing the world**. It is already about making these crazy virtual worlds where anything can happen. 

Wow – theatre **is** 'VR' 

VR is perfect for theatre. 

# Theatre is perfect for virtual reality!

Perhaps VR is the stage. In a similar way that old wooden stage is, or TV, or Film. But even more-so.
Is it that, what we have here with VR is, by its very nature, another very natural place for theatre? 
The concept of the virtual Avatar is relatively new, but could this be analogous to costume and make-up? 
Is the idea of embodiment in VR so different to simply getting into character? These are natural questions raised by the nature of this project.

In fact, is it going to far to suggest that **theatre IS virtual reality**?! When we create theatre, no matter what form it takes, it is a kind of Virtual Reality, in a form of its very own. If this is the case, then, as the human condition appears to need to create theatre, then does VR tap into something very similar? In the same way that video games tap into and immerse us into alternative realities, allowing us to become someone else or to experience something from another person's perspective, within a situation that is not ‘real’, but is an *alternative* to *actual* reality?

# Virtual Reality is absolutely made for theatre!

So, in this way, the NNE version of the **reality-virtuality continuum** is the continuum between performers in reality, being realised in virtual reality, where they are consumed, interacted with, affected, before being relayed back into reality (via the controller app).
