title: The Project - Not Near Enough
published: true
---

**Not Near Enough** is a **[StoryFutures Academy](https://www.storyfutures.com/academy)**-funded project at Falmouth University exploring VR theatre spaces. 

>The brief for this project is to create an adaptable and interactive virtual theatre space where
actors and audience meet. The same space would also function as a teaching and rehearsal
space for Falmouth students and staff.

During the past week I put together an expression of interest, resulting in an invitation from the team leaders to discuss the possibility of my working on the project. This took place on Monday, and yesterday (Tuesday) I was invited to join the project as **VR Unity Developer**.

## Notes from initial discussion

# Brief outline - project background

* **StoryFutures Academy** - one of the government's appointed 'creative clusters'. Collaboration between Royal Holloway University of London and National Film and Television School, who are primaritly interested in funding and upskilling businesses and organisations in the West London area in new digital media - VR, AR, XR etc. 
* **Train The Trainer** is a StoryFutures initiative as part of a funding strand offered to work with universities across the country.
* Five universities have this funding - Falmouth, Hertfordshire, Abertay, UCL, Bath Spa.
* The funding is, in this case, to be used for a **'teaching-led'** project.
* Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this year Falmouth University **AMATA** (Academy of Music and Theatre Arts) are devising a project that is about creating for an immersive, virtual environment.
* The view of the directors is that theatre, performance, acting students - those interested in live performance - are better placed to consider such spaces than film and television students, because they are used to working in spaces that happen all around, be they real or virtual.
* We will be working with **theatre and performance** students and **technical theatre arts** students.
* The students will be engaged in creating content for the environment.
* **20** students in total: **16** theatre and performance and **4** technical theatre arts.



# The environment

* Important: the **'liveness'** and **'interactiveness'**
* Visual concept - the **'varyon'** - morphs and moves around the audience.
* As well as images of performers streamed into the environment, they would like some form of **'volumetric capture'** if possible, where the performers appear in the space as a kind of **'hologram'**, or **'avatar'**.
* This can be incomplete, blocky or outlined etc. - i.e.  not a full perfect representation.
* Audience will wear headsets
* Performers streamed in via, for example, cameras or laptops.
* Interested in how an audience with audience interaction might _look like_, how would they be aware of each other's presence, how will they interact with the space?
* Audience of approximately 8-10.
* One idea is to maybe pick four formations created by the screens, and the audience transitions between them via an animation, with each space being seen as an interactive 'installation' space. 
* Klaus Kruse (director) outlined possible ideas for 'flow' through the space(s).
* Potential for audience members to split up and explore difference spaces before joining together in a joint _'grand finale'_ / _'communal conclusion'_.
* There is an awareness of the possible limitations and realisation that not every idea may be possible, or feasible given the time and technical limitations.
* The animations can be derived from the experience of the way the screens, each of which hinges onto the next, move when the space changes its shape.
* It would be hoped that the audience can interact with the screens in at least one of the spaces - push, move, realign into different shapes.
* Live interaction via video so the audience can see and speak with the performers - live feed.
* This would also mean the space can be used as a live rehearsal space.
* The audience sees the performer on the screen.
* Pixelation etc. will be 'embraced' and become part of the aesthetic.
* Students can maybe access the space via 360 degree video displayed on google cardboard via phones.

# Research, experimentation, dialogue and R&D

This is very much a dialogue, a collaboration. There is space for me, as a developer to bring to the project. It is likely that, as theatre practitioners, the project devisers and leaders of the project have thought aobut differentely, or have ideas that are not necessarily feasible in the way they imagined them. This project is in many respects, an R&D project - there is a lot of research and experimentation to be done in attempting to realise something that is close to the original concepts. 

There is also the potential for publishing a research paper or two at the end of the project. It this stage, I see this as something I'd be interested in being invovled in.

# Time scale

They would like something ready and working - certainly not complete - during September, or start of October, in order to work with students within the virtual space.

# Collaboration

It was agreed that, should it be necessary or helpful to bring in external expertise as and when necessary, we will do so. I'm thinking potentially in terms of graphics, animations, character or environment aesthetics etc., that this could be a good thing to do.
