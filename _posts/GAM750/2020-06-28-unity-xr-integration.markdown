# Considering XR Integration as a replacement for Oculus Integration

XR is the future. Unity is developing a multi-platform solution for both VR and AR development that exposes functionality in low-level C# APIs.

I began looking at the possibility of creating my 'boilerplate' start-up project using Unity XR and ditching the 'old' Oculus Integration SDK. However, a concern is that, while there are many good reasons to do this, XR _may_ not be fully developed enough on which to base my immediate project.

The Oculus SDK is tried and tested and I am comfortable enough using it. While the multi-platform nature of Unity XR will be very useful in time, setting up and incorporating it could set me on a steep new learning curve that I perhaps don't have time for right now. 'Upgrading' to XR at some stage could always be an option, even if it could prove tricky and time-consuming. It could always be done at an apporpriate time in the product's development lifecycle.

Oculus Quest **hand tracking** is something I know I would like to explore, and it's currently being developed by Oculus, with updates appearing fairly regularly. Currently this is not an option with XR integration. I imagine it will appear at some point, but I currently cannot find any confirmation.

It would be a shame, because I always like to keep up to speed with the latest developments - it's easy to fall behind in this fast-moving business - but in practically terms, this could be one occasion that the best option would be to stick with the tried-and-tested pair of old comfortable shoes.
