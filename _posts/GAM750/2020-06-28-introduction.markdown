Whatever my final project turns out to be, it will be a multiplayer of some sort and will have media streamed into the VR from outside, media streamed from VR to outside, and control data streamed into VR from outside.

These are the more difficult of the tasks I envisage, so will need to research and learn these early on.

## Options I am currently aware of

# Multiplayer 

* [Photon PUN2]({% link _posts/GAM750/2020-07-01-photon.markdown %}): as discussed in GAM720
* [Mirror]({% link _posts/GAM750/2020-07-02-mirror.markdown %}): looks very interesting 

# Streaming options

* WebRTC
* Genvid
* Agora
