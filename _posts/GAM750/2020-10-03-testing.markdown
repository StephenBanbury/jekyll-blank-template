# User Testing

There will not likely be any formal user testing. In effect, the performances, which will be the first time the students will be showing the performances they have been working on as their virtual audio-visual tools were being developed alongside. Hopefully, the project will continue to run beyond this point, where more structured forms of testing can be implemented.

The following videos show some of the users using the environment.
