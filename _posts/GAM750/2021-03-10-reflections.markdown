* I set out to use the opportunities presented by this project to explore the potential of a multiplayer, virtual environment as a platform for creative endeavour in theatre, whilst building on my own skills as a researcher, developer and artist.  

  - I have succeeded in my goal of building an environment that meets the stakeholders' requirements.
  - I have developed a technical stack to achieve these aims.
  - I have learned about multiplayer technologies and, in Normcore, found a very useable, cost-effective and forward-thinking solution for future projects.
  - I have learned about media streaming, and bringing video from outside and into the virtual environment. Furthermore, have built a way for communication to happen between the two.
  - I have had a great oportunity to work with other artists and to think about the creative process, both in terms of theatre and in a more abstract, general sense. I have begun to understand how an immersive, virtual environment can be used for creative ends, and even maybe enhance creativity. It certainly provides new ways of thinking about creative practice, beyond traditions.
  - The research I have done is just the start - I have discovered areas that provide fascinating oportunities for further research. 
  - As an artist myself, I have ideas for future projects that will combine what I have learned here with my own creative practice.

* The studentsâ€™ own presentations reveal a variety of creative responses, demonstrating both an ease of engaging with the unfamiliar environment and the environment itself as a tool for exploring new ways of thinking about, and making, theatre. 
  
  - The work done by the students shows they way the environment has been embraced, and how fears have, apparently, been overcome. 
  - It is impossible to be sure that this is the case, though, until full user-testing has been undertaken, including surveys, discussions and interviews, in order to get the students and the expert stakeholders' views and opinions.

* Preparations are currently underway for the continuing development of Not Near Enough.  Most immediately, it has been confirmed that the work will be presented at the 2021 National Student Drama Festival, and plans are being put in place to publish a peer-reviewed academic paper discussing the project.
   
  - The festival submission, due to the pandemic, will involve 360 degree capture from within the audience environment. 
  - Future work will involve developing the artefact to make it more user-friendly for users from non-technical backgrounds to be able to start making work with it, with the flattest learning curve possible. 
  - In this way, it has the potential to become a commercial product. 
  <br><br>
* However, the sense that this is, in fact, just the beginning is enticing me to take forward what has been learned, particularly in relation to the controller app, so as to further progress as a researcher, developer, artist and practitioner, and to drive what I am certain will become a rich source for further research and development, exploring issues of embodiment and identity, whilst investigating collaborative creation within virtual multiplayer settings.  
  
  - The research I have done is just the start - I have discovered areas that provide fascinating oportunities for further research. 
  - The area around the breaking down of the reality-virtuality continuum is particularly exciting, and my intention is to continue to  create work that explores the combining of different 'levels' of virtuality.
  <br><br>
* An exciting and more immediate prospect, however, is that, as a result of what I have learned from working on Not Near Enough, I have been invited to teach undergraduate theatre students at Falmouth University, as a visiting lecturer, about this area of practice. 

  - This is an interesting and new area for me, and one which I hope will lead to more of the same.
  - It will not only allow me to help and enthuse students to explore these areas of creative practice, but will feed into my own research, development and my own creative practice.
