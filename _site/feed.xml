&lt;p&gt;The tutorial has a useful introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/pun/v2/demos-and-tutorials/pun-basics-tutorial/player-prefab&quot;&gt;building and animating the player character(s)&lt;/a&gt;. This is not PUN-specific so comes as an unexpected but welcome addition, as character animation is something that I will need to look into sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The robot prefab is provided for demo/experimental purposes as part of the Photon PUN 2 asset download, as are the animations required to get him moving (running, swinging arms etc.). These need attaching to the robot GameObject along with a character controller and the usual collision detector etc. The tutorial provides help on this and setting the animator in motion. However, I am clear that I will need to learn how to create 3D objects like this, as well as build character animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running and jumping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The robot character is not easy to control, being limited in its ability to stop, turn without running forwards, only jump in a single, slightly ‘parkour’ style and it can only run at a certain speed. Of course, there is much more that can be done to improve things. This ‘demo’ does indicate, however, how much more work would need to go into creating a more usable animated character that is enjoyable to play with.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Building and animating a player character</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week Two - Suspension Of Disbelief</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/02/10/week-three-suspension-of-disbelief.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week Two - Suspension Of Disbelief" /><published>2020-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/02/10/week-three-suspension-of-disbelief</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/02/10/week-three-suspension-of-disbelief.html"></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Building The Multiplayer Environment | Part 1</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/02/09/building-the-multiplayer-environment-part1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Building The Multiplayer Environment | Part 1" /><published>2020-02-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/02/09/building-the-multiplayer-environment-part1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/02/09/building-the-multiplayer-environment-part1.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;photon-pun-2--unity&quot;&gt;Photon PUN 2 &amp;amp; Unity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Photon PUN documentation, which appear to be as clear as I’d hoped, provides what looks to be a fairly straightforward &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/pun/v2/demos-and-tutorials/pun-basics-tutorial/intro&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; towards creating a simple multiplayer enabled application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API documentation can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc-api.photonengine.com/en/pun/v2/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;connections-and-joining-rooms&quot;&gt;Connections and joining rooms&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first piece of code, attached to an empty GameObject, is to connect to the Photon Cloud server and attempt to join a random room - if no room exists then one is created and that is joined. This was one of those rare magic moments, when it worked first time! Unity PlayerPrefs is used to strore the player’s entered user name across states, thus maintaining it for the next time the app is started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Tutorial, as is usually the case with kind of thing, is not specifically aimed at the kind of work I intend to do.  Instead, it appears to use a fairly generic game pattern - I’ve yet to penetrate deaply enough to truly be sure as to how generic - as a vehicle for introducing the core ideas and concepts behind Photon PUN 2. I have often found in these cases that it is generally useful to continue the course, if not to its completion, then at least some way in to it - or at least until it is felt that enough core concepts have been unearthed for work to begin with the confidence that anything new and unknown can be researched as and when it is required. The balancing trick is in assessing whether this point has been reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I created four scenes, each representing a room in which the players can enter. I used the convention whereby the name of the room follows the number of players that have joined, and so, as a new player joins, all the players move to the corresponding room. Conversely, as a player leaves, all players move to a room with 1 less player in its title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use is made of the PUN callbacks (exposed through &lt;strong&gt;MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks&lt;/strong&gt;, which extends the standard Unity MonoBehaviour class) to detect if players join or leave.&lt;/p&gt;

There appear to be a number of options that I will need to research in order to better understand the potential differences, similarities, advantages and disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;past-musings&quot;&gt;Past musings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having never made a multiplayer game I’m starting from a very low base. However, more than one of my ideas for a creative app during ideation for GAM730 - the co-creative project - included multiplayer settings. At the time, without undertaking any serious research, I considered using a Firebase &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore&quot;&gt;Firestore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; database as a central hub, to which multiple clients could connect. This appeared to offer the most important aspect of interconnectivity - a full-duplex connection that immediately pushes any changes made to the database, by any connected client app, out to all other connected client apps. Beyond this, I did not do much further investigating. As I am about to embark on a full scale research activity I will find out just how naive this thinking was. Or not, as the case may be. I’m sure it’s not going to be as simple as this, but the fundamentals of WebSocket-style connectivity and a central database must, surely, be a major part! I shall find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;in-no-particular-order-options-recommended-returned-as-search-results-and-other-discoveries-along-the-way&quot;&gt;In no particular order: options recommended, returned as search results, and other discoveries along the way&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unity Networking: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001252086-UNet-Deprecation-FAQ&quot;&gt;Depricated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;UNet, Unity’s legacy multiplayer solution, does not meet the needs of many multiplayer game creators. To reach the performance, scale, and security goals of Unity creators, we’ve reached the difficult decision that completely new technology is required, including lightweight and fast networking, and a dedicated game server model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.photonengine.com/en-US/PUN&quot;&gt;Photon PUN 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Photon is a real-time multiplayer game development framework that is fast, lean and flexible. Photon consists of a server and multiple client SDKs for major platforms - &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc-api.photonengine.com/en/pun/v2/&quot;&gt;Photon API documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The Photon Unity Networking library (PUN) immediately stands out due to its integration with Unity.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It supports peer-to-peer networking, rather than all messages needing to transmit via the host. This means PUN is pretty fast, accoring to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raywenderlich.com/1142814-introduction-to-multiplayer-games-with-unity-and-photon&quot;&gt;raywenderlich.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, when compared with, say, Unity’s own networking solution.
&lt;img src=&quot;\images\unity-photon-api-difference.png&quot; alt=&quot;Unity Transport Layer API&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;PUN provides 20 Concurrent Users (CCU) for free, along with 8000 monthly activities and 500 messages per room, plus an option of $95 for three years, including 100 CCUs and 40K monthly activities. This is certainly interesting for small indie developers, who are certain to be on a budget.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It appears that tutorials and documentation are a strong point and there are a decent number of tutorial videos available on YouTube.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This immediately looks interesting as I do not want to spend much of the 9 weeks development time available (three sprints of 3 weeks each) setting up complex structures of my own, such as multiplayer server, database and websocket connections. The fact that this is free for low-level development, and reasonably-priced should I need to step up a level, also adds appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-is-photon-bolt-and-how-does-it-differ-to-photon-pun-2&quot;&gt;So what is &lt;strong&gt;Photon Bolt&lt;/strong&gt; and how does it differ to Photon PUN 2?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.photonengine.com/bolt&quot;&gt;Bolt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are game networking middleware. 
A comparison is provided &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/pun/v2/reference/pun-vs-bolt&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic summary of difference: &lt;strong&gt;Host Client (Bolt) Vs. Dedicated Server (PUN)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;PUN&lt;/strong&gt;, if the Master Client (i.e. special client that acts in a similar way to a dedicated host) quits, another actor -if available- will become the new Master Client. And so on, until there are no more clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;Bolt&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, the server is “static”; the “client” that starts up the game and choose to become the server, will stay as the server. If the host client (server) quits, none of the other clients will become a server (and all of them will be disconnected, of course.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bolt appears to be take more control away from the developer, which can be a time-saver. I’m leaning towards the greater control provided by PUN as I would like to gain a greater depth of understanding of the processes involved. In any case, I like to have more control over what I am doing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automatic compression is a bonus for Bolt, whereas the PUN developer may have to implement it themself. However, PUN sends data from client to other peers through the relay by default (without passing through the master-client). Conversely, Bolt &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; has to pass through the hosting machine, thus adding latency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/introducing-agones-open-source-multiplayer-dedicated-game-server-hosting-built-on-kubernetes&quot;&gt;Google Agones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source, multiplayer, dedicated game-server hosting built on Kubernetes. This is something I’d like to find out more about. In particular the fact that it uses Kubernetes, another technology I’ve had in my sights for some time, and it is Google, which is certainly not one of the smaller companies. The fact that it is still relatively early days perhaps makes it less appealing when I’m looking for something to get set up and running quickly and is supported by a large base of users and documentation. However, I’m sure it, or its successors, will have a big future in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heroiclabs.com/docs/&quot;&gt;Nakama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nakama is an open-source scalable server for building social and realtime apps and games.
Looks very interesting but maybe a bit heavyweight for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t spent an exhaustive amount of time researching theses options and I’m sure there are even more out there. The task is made more difficult because I am researching a subject I know little to nothing about and, therefore, I find myself not completely certain if the diffent products I am reading about exist for the same purpose or if the apparent subtle differences are, in fact, major ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Agones and Nakama look interesting, but I am uncertain if how they would be put into use. If I had more time then perhaps I’d look further into their potential, but for now, I feel they will demand too much of my time when I really want to get on with building something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photon PUN 2 and Photon Bolt are both interesting and, in comparison with the offerings from Google and Nakama, I find the quantity and clarity of documentation, tutorials and general discussion surrounding them to to be helpful to my understanding of their purpose. Pricing structure for both is the same. However, despite the apparent greater simplicity of Bolt over PUN, the latter is more appealing due to the greater control and potential for learning and acquiring a greater depth of understanding through its use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I shall begin delving deeper into the potential of &lt;strong&gt;Photon PUN 2&lt;/strong&gt; as a multiplayer server solution for my project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VRTK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with PUN?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am researching about possibilities to make multi user experiences for the Quest and have been wondering if Photon would help?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;yes&lt;/li&gt;

In particular the fact that it uses Kubernetes, another technology I’ve had in my sights for some time, and it is Google, which is certainly not one of the smaller companies. The fact that it is still relatively early days perhaps makes it less appealing when I’m looking for something to get set up and running quickly and is supported by a large base of users and documentation. However, I’m sure it, or its successors, will have a big future in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heroiclabs.com/docs/&quot;&gt;Nakama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nakama is an open-source scalable server for building social and realtime apps and games.
Looks very interesting but maybe a bit heavyweight for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t spent an exhaustive amount of time researching theses options and I’m sure there are even more out there. The task is made more difficult because I am researching a subject I know little to nothing about and, therefore, I find myself not completely certain if the diffent products I am reading about exist for the same purpose or if the apparent subtle differences are, in fact, major ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Agones and Nakama look interesting, but I am uncertain if how they would be put into use. If I had more time then perhaps I’d look further into their potential, but for now, I feel they will demand too much of my time when I really want to get on with building something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photon PUN 2 and Photon Bolt are both interesting and, in comparison with the offerings from Google and Nakama, I find the quantity and clarity of documentation, tutorials and general discussion surrounding them to to be helpful to my understanding of their purpose. Pricing structure for both is the same. However, despite the apparent greater simplicity of Bolt over PUN, the latter is more appealing due to the greater control and potential for learning and acquiring a greater depth of understanding through its use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I shall begin delving deeper into the potential of &lt;strong&gt;Photon PUN 2&lt;/strong&gt; as a multiplayer server solution for my project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VRTK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with PUN?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am researching about possibilities to make multi user experiences for the Quest and have been wondering if Photon would help?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;yes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;polyphony&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polyphony&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A musical texture created by multiple individual and independent parts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that I will be taking forward for this project is to use Virtual Reality in the creation of an immersive space in which two ‘players’ can join together to create sonic and visual effects and events, though physical actions and interactions. The results of such actions may be seen as ephemeral visual and aural moments that exist for a short time after an event is triggered. The space will be an environment in which the players can experiment and create through playful interactions with the space, the objects within it, and the players themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cacophony&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cacophony&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A harsh, discordant, jarring, mixture of sounds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, as the developer, this will be a vehicle to exlore, not only the technical problems, issues and solutions involved in creating such an event, but also to attempt to use freedom from the physical world in order to transend the nature of objects as we understand them, pushing the possibilities of how we can expect them to react, sonically and visually, as the result of actions directed upon them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to witness not only how participants interact with these stimuli within a shared space, but also how each interacts with the other. Will there be an attempt to create something collaboratively, in the mode of a ‘jam’, or will they find there is too much stimuli to comfortably handle, resulting in the need to escape? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;phony&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phony&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fake, not genuine or real&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to the immersive environment, how does the nature and aesthetic quality of the virtual space itself affect how the players react to it and to each other? And, through the exploration of sound in virtual reality, will it be possible to explore the accoustic qualities of the space and how, for instance, artificial sound waves bounce off virtual surfaces?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be that I find a way to ‘record’ the event so that it can be replayed and experienced from a different perspective, viewed as a creative artefact ‘object’, that is experienced rather differently to the live event that caused it to come into existence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Create a Game - Dog Walker Simulator</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/02/04/dog-walker-simulator.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Create a Game - Dog Walker Simulator" /><published>2020-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/02/04/dog-walker-simulator</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/02/04/dog-walker-simulator.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;brief&quot;&gt;Brief:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes average people are called to extraordinary measures. It happens all the time in movies, books and on television. Innumerable action movies pit people against one another and push them past the point where the ‘common man or woman’ become quite uncommon: Erin Brockovich is a classic example of such a person. 
For this activity, your task is to select a common man or woman in a normal job in a fairly average world: there is nothing that might cause you to think twice about them. To test this, ask yourself ‘would I presently watch a movie that covered the last week in the life of this person?’, if the answer is yes, then the odds are you do not find them common at all. Think of a common but not specific person you meet in your everyday life: a grocery-store employee; construction worker; bus driver; or cab / taxi driver. Any profession that is common will do. 
Now, think of how you could build a game based on the character’s everyday life when it suddenly takes a dramatic turn. The situation changes suddenly and the person is forced to step up and go beyond what they thought was humanly possible. Luckily, they have your trusty app to give them extra superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliverables:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A brief description of a common man or woman character (this could be based on some persona development).
Details of a realistic, inciting moment that makes the character uncommon. 
A non-digital game design, based on the character, that utilises your app as part of the gameplay to bestow superpowers upon the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggested process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pick a common profession and a common man or woman. Create a persona for them.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Determine what the inciting moment will be. It could be something like the death of a loved one and the desire for revenge (Max Payne) or as seemingly trivial as the race to fill seats and serve people at a restaurant (Diner Dash).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Determine a type of game to build. What kind of core dynamics would suit the character and how would they use your app to save the day?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Create a deliverable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dog-walker-simulator&quot;&gt;Dog Walker Simulator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crystal is a dog-walker by profession. She has build a trusting client base over the past 5 years and, through the dogs, has made many friends - or at least that’s how she likes to see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this particular, unusual, day, the dogs seem to be behaving rather differently to the lovely calm creatures she has become used to. Fido, for some unfathomable reason, has decided to snap at Tia whenever she comes close. This is a problem, particularly as she is tethered to the lead next to Fido. Thankfully, the app on her phone, which shows the georgeous little pooches via glorious Augmented Reality, allows Crystal to move Tia to the other side of the pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this now means that Rusty is next to Fido, and Rusty seems to have picked up a severe case of unwelcome, itchy, leaping, guests (flees). These begin jumping from Rusty onto Fido’s coat. Fido begins scratching, which causes the pack to swerve to the right! Luckily, the app allows Crystal to tug at the lead and bring Fido back into line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Benji has picked up the odor of a freshly-cooked pie that has been left on a windowsill to cool.  Benji lurches to the left, causing the leads to cross and twist and this trips up poor old Sukie. Whilst in the act of untwisting the leads, Crystal notices that Trixy has managed slip her collar, is running down the riverbank and is about to leap into the water after a family of ducks…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of dogs that Crystal manages to bring back to their owners in the condition they were entrusted to her care decides whether she can continue another day in her chosen profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app makes use of stylised animated dogs in Augmented Reality, set in the real locale through coupling with Google API and Google Cloud Anchors. This simulates the experience of walking a bunch of very cute, very lively, but extremely distracted dogs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day in the life of the dog-walker. You couldn’t make it up!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-2&quot;&gt;Take 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m updating my idea to better fit the brief.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;woofers&quot;&gt;Woofers!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\beagle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beagle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crystal is out on one of her dog-walking excursions. She has five or six dogs each on a lead. As she begins to turn off the pavement alongside a busy road, a passing fire engine suddenly and unexpectedly turns on its very loud and piercing siren..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WEEE-OOOO-WEEE-OOOO…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startled, the dogs yank themselves free and run off, leads attached, into the park in various different directions! OMG!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Momentarily panicking, Crystal does not know what she is going to do, and thoughts turn to how on earth she is going to explain this to the owners when she returns without their darling doggies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But.. she remembers that the dogs have GPS devices attached to their leads and she has an app on her phone so they can be tracked. How very forward-thinking of her!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She starts up the app and within 30 seconds all dogs have been located on a Google map. She immediately starts off in the direction of Rusty, who appears to be heading towards a dangerous looking dual carriageway. She decides she’ll come back for those that are more close-by as soon as Rusty is safe..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliverable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app will use geofencing, with fences located on randomly moving points. The player must find the virtual pooches, by locating the moving geofences, before they are lost for good or, worse, they meet a sticky end or they get caught by the dog-warden! The dog characters are represented using Anime-cartoon-style graphics and a checklist is provided to tick off the dogs as they are brought back to safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Woof’ if you think all the dogs can be found withing the time-limit!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Brief:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Humble beginnings | Ideation Part 3</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/02/04/humble-beginnings-part3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Humble beginnings | Ideation Part 3" /><published>2020-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/02/04/humble-beginnings-part3</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/02/04/humble-beginnings-part3.html">&lt;p&gt;Considering past rapid ideation and prototyping ideas has thrown up another possibility. 
&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/25/week-three-appjam-2.html&quot;&gt;The Odd Word Out&lt;/a&gt; was a simple idea that became an MVP, my intention being to pick it up later for further development. At the time I wrote: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is significant potential for further development of the concept of arcade-style word games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I had not thought of this in terms of Virtual Reality, but the potential is there for this to be a fun word game with an educational slant. It would not necessarily lose its arcade-style appeal, although it would gain a sophistication that would be interesting to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a 2D space I could have the words, maybe in the form of balls or other 3D objects, bouncing off walls, floors and ceilings within an immersive 3D space. It would the task of the player to knock out words by hurling related - or unrelated - words at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or it could, for instance, become a kind of shooting game where the principle of eliminating certain words remains, but the method is entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;

Although, to some extent, I feel I am able to fall back on the cushion that is provided by the concept agile development, it has felt as though there is still not quite  enough hard material on whilch ideas can crystalise in order to really get going on the project. I’m not 100% certain that it is necessary, as I a feel capable of allowing the ideas to overcome any inertia and start to flow once underway. But it’s an uncomfortable feeling nonetheless. If I can begin with something in my sights, something that I can start to build a &lt;strong&gt;narrative&lt;/strong&gt; around, then I can start making headway with a sharper initial focus, a real sense of excitement and full of positive expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose this kind of frustration can be seen as part of the process of ideation. Or, perhaps, I have been thinking about what it is that I &lt;strong&gt;ought&lt;/strong&gt; to make, rather than what I would &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; to make - it turns out that these concepts are actually not so far apart! However, with the emphasis on the latter, I feel there is greater justification and suddenly I have started feeling those tingles of excitement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how have my ideas moved forward? Firstly, I began to think about my background as a musician and sound artist and, in particular, one of the ambitions I identified near the start of the course - during the first assignment of &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/04/week-one-creative-assignment.html&quot;&gt;GAM710&lt;/a&gt; to be precise. In my conclusion I wrote: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The interactive nature of an online music collaboration or jamming concept is fascinatingly open to the potential of enhancement and the development of ideas beyond connecting and interacting in a purely audio environment. I would be interested in exploring the possibilities of connecting visually and immersively, into areas of &lt;strong&gt;virtual and augmented reality&lt;/strong&gt;. The potential for musicians to immerse themselves in a virtual environment in which they could play alongside each other could be extremely exciting. Facial recognition and ‘super-imposition’ technologies could potentially allow musicians to experience &lt;strong&gt;playing alongside anyone, or anything, in a place of their own choosing&lt;/strong&gt;, including with ‘celebrities’ or even fictitious cartoon creations of their own making or purchased from an online library of characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I almost immediately realised that this absolutely satisfies the main ambitions expressed so far on this module, which is to explore the use of Virtual Reality in the creation of a shared immersive space in which some kind of collaboration or interaction between individuals can happen, in an educational or purely creative setting. The potential is there for this to form the basis of a formally-structured game, as it is for laying the foundations for something far looser and more participant-driven, such as simply jamming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;idea-1&quot;&gt;Idea 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my first idea is to explore the creation of a shared immersive environment in which I can facilitate player collaboration in the creation of music, or at least, ‘musical’ sound. This will ideally entail the development of some form of game, which will ultimately be integral to the formal musical ‘structure’ that is created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;idea-2&quot;&gt;Idea 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am concerned about the lack of VR headsets at my disposal - I own just the one Oculus Quest. I would like to explore, as an alternative, the potential for one player to make use of a different platform, such as tablet or PC. If this proves to be too problematic, then I have a back-up idea, which is to create a kind of &lt;strong&gt;multi-track&lt;/strong&gt; recording device in VR. The idea would be to &lt;strong&gt;record&lt;/strong&gt; a single sound ‘track’ as it is created by the player - and maybe also the movements and actions of the player along with any other associated visual stimulae - and then to &lt;strong&gt;over-dub&lt;/strong&gt; this with another track, followed by another, then another…&lt;br /&gt;
Ultimately, a mutli-layered world of sound - and potentially visuals - could be created by a single individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel these ideas are sarting to come together. I need to decide if it’s worth starting with &lt;strong&gt;idea 1&lt;/strong&gt; and moving onto &lt;strong&gt;idea 2&lt;/strong&gt; if I am unable to manage the multiplayer aspect, or to simply chose &lt;strong&gt;idea 2&lt;/strong&gt; from the outset. The latter does not fully satisfy my original ambitions for collaboration between more than one individual but, of course, it could in time be made to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;idea-3&quot;&gt;Idea 3&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering past rapid ideation and prototyping ideas has thrown up another possibility. 
&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/02/25/week-three-appjam-2.html&quot;&gt;The Odd Word Out&lt;/a&gt; was a simple idea that became an MVP, my intention being to pick it up later for further development. At the time I wrote: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My initial idea&lt;/strong&gt; stems from twin desires to create a collaborative, interactive, ‘multi-player’ space in Virtual Reality and to develop ways for educational or therapeutic (such as autistic spectrum disorder) activities to take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My starting point will be to create a suitable immersive space to be ‘shared’ by student and teacher. I will explore the use of avatars as representations of the participants and will study this in comparison with a lack of visual human representation. Initially, the student will use the VR headset and the teacher will use a phone or tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will introduce a simple interactive concept based on question and response, or action and reaction. The teacher will ask something of the student and will provide a suitable reward if the response is satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have an interest in sound and music, I will approach this as part of an exploration of sound creation and manipulation within a virtual space. For this to happen, some kind of participant action will clearly be required as will both sonic and visual elements within the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will enable me to begin studying the possibilities and effectiveness of immersive technologies in therapeutic and education settings. It will also allow me to experiment with visual and aural aesthetics and the inclusion of visual human interaction, all with the potential to gain insights into human response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;as-i-further-develop-my-idea&quot;&gt;As I further develop my idea…&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I begin to think about how the narrative, along the lines of &lt;strong&gt;storyworld&lt;/strong&gt; rather than &lt;strong&gt;storyline&lt;/strong&gt;, can be more interesting. If this were to be more of a game rather than &lt;em&gt;simply&lt;/em&gt; responding to a set of given tasks. Perhaps this could be along the lines of a &lt;em&gt;spree&lt;/em&gt;, where the ‘student’ returns a series of &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; responses, only for this to fail as soon as an &lt;em&gt;incorrect&lt;/em&gt; response is given. Similar to a game of &lt;strong&gt;Simon&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\simon-electronic-game.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simon Game&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, of course a very simple game - one of the reasons that &lt;em&gt;Simon&lt;/em&gt; appeals to me as a potential vehicle for therapeutic purposes. Anacdotally, and through experience, simple games can be used as a task-driven activity as a form of ‘paring’ exercise, encouraging, amongst other things, inter-personal communication, socialisation and concentration. Of course, there is research to be done to back my statement up, but this is an example of how I envisage a simple game activity that could potentially be used within an immersive therapeutic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This style of simple interactive game could also form the basis around which the various complex and challenging aspects can be studied and built. For example, the intention to experiement with a multi-player setup with sound, lights, haptics and other sensory feedback. I also wish to look at aesthetics and what difference a well-designed (which is entirely subjective of course) environment can have compared to something considered to be less successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slightly anacdotally, my search for a VR version of Simon only unearthed what I initially thought must be an &lt;em&gt;Augmented Reality&lt;/em&gt; version of the game, requiring a Microft Hololens or something equally sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\simon-headset-box.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simon Game Box&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\simon-headset-game2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simon headset&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in fact it turned out to be a simple piece of hardware that consists of coloured LEDs and motion detectors that respond to the close proximity of the player’s hand. It is interesting that the VR headset was clearly an inspiration and used for its perception as ‘cutting edge’ technology and an associated cudos that it almost certainly does not deserve. I am sure it would become both extremely tiring and annoying in a very short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, a true VR version of Simon does not appear to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
