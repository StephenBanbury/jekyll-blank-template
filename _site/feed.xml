&lt;p&gt;When I started the MA, I had been working for a decade with databases and data analysis, and for the following six years on a web-based database-connected application, using the Microsoft .NET MVC platform with HTML and JavaScript for the front-end. I held the assumption that I’d naturally continue down the path of web-based development, but I also wanted to explore the creative possibilities of mobile development. Anything beyond this was a little vague. However, the one thing I was certain about was that I’d like to start working to a much greater extent with the user-facing, interactive side of app development - this excites me far more than working further back in the stack with databases and business intelligence. I wanted to make apps that are useful, interesting, look good, sound good and importantly, are fun to use. I also started out with a desire to explore the potential of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Virtual and Augmented Reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;games-and-learning&quot;&gt;Games and Learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I did not expect to become involved with is games. However, it did not take long, after starting the course, to find myself considering education-focused games as a possible avenue to explore. My App Jam project, an education-focused arcade-style game, started me thinking about the value of games in a wider context than I had previously, particularly as a means of drawing in the user and holding their attention in order to facilitate learning via a fun activity and playful environment. For me, this idea was confirmed and developed in week eight’s course material - &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/04/18/week-eight-what-is-creativity.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is Creativity?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - where it was noted that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;games are not purely about entertainment, but can also be powerful tools for learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-potential-for-vr-in-education-games&quot;&gt;The potential for VR in education games&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course material for week five - &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/03/14/week-five-types-of-app.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Types of App&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - had allowed me to begin finding a context for these ideas and to start thinking about existing markets, such as those for &lt;em&gt;Gamification&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Serious Games&lt;/em&gt;. The latter had started to draw me into thinking about the immersive nature and educational potential of &lt;em&gt;Virtual Reality&lt;/em&gt; - for instance, its ability to place its audience within an environment created such that they would be empowered to experience something close to the reality of a particular place, situation or event from history. An example is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zk3cmfr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC 1943 Berlin Blitz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; virtual reality experience, in which the audience is taken in a Lancaster bomber on a blitz raid over Berlin during the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\bbc-berlin-blitz.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;BBC 1943 Berlin Blitz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece is particularly powerful because it is a recreation of a real-life event based on the voice-recorded narrative of a contemporary WW2 journalist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynford_Vaughan-Thomas&quot;&gt;Wynford Vaughan-Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, who risked his own life (and that of his recording engineer) in order to accompany the mission. I accidentally and fortuitously encountered a BBC television documentary - unfortunately I have not since been able to find a copy or any documentation of it - where the Berlin Blitz experience was tried out by a group of school pupils - it was notable how the learning process was found to be more intense and more valuable to the pupils when history was experienced as if they were actual participants, as opposed to reading facts in a text book, disconnected from reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;virtual-reality-and-autism-spectrum-disorder&quot;&gt;Virtual Reality and Autism Spectrum Disorder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking further about VR, I came to consider its potential to create an environment that can be comfortably explored by autistic people. I should explain at this point that my younger son, who is now eight years old, was provided with an early diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as a toddler. His mother and I have spent a significant amount of time concerning ourselves with his education and development and have put together a predominantly home-schooled programme based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis&quot;&gt;Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA)&lt;/a&gt;: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a scientific discipline concerned with applying techniques based upon the principles of learning to change behaviour of social significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there is a lot of potential with autism and VR. Autism is very much about difficulties of socialisation and how one relates to the world and communicates with other people. This can be a very difficult thing for autistic people to deal with. The world that most of us take for granted, in which we spend a large proportion of our lives socialising and interacting with others, can often cause confusion, intense anxiety and feelings of isolation for autistic people. If it is possible for Virtual Reality to create environments in which people with autism feel comfortable and are able to communicate with others whilst circumventing problems associated with an inability to read and understand the subtleties of expression and social interaction, then VR could be an extremely useful and potentially important tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My week nine journal entry on &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/04/19/week-nine-emerging-tech.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;emerging technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows some of the research I have begun in this area. I came across practitioners in the field of autism research who appear to be quite excited about the possibilities of VR and are thinking about it in a similar way to me. Most appear to be academics within the field of autistic research, rather than working within software development or technology. I’ve read of people doing research into the use of VR in autism and finding very little, and at the time, I myself found very little. I recognised that I needed to do more thorough research into this, but I believed there to be a potential market for the use of VR and AR in autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-market-emerges&quot;&gt;A market emerges&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have come across a company in the United States - &lt;a href=&quot;https://floreotech.com/&quot;&gt;Floreo&lt;/a&gt; - who have created a VR product that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;is based on established social and communication techniques intended to help individuals with ASD build real world skills. Specifically, we are developing content for learning discrete social behaviors, managing planned and unplanned events, and improving sensory and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\floreo-vr.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Floreo VR&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it does, after all, appear that a market has opened up for VR and ASD. That said, I intend to continue to research this area as it is clearly in its infancy and there could be scope for plenty more research. ASD is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is.aspx?gclid=Cj0KCQjwtr_mBRDeARIsALfBZA5u4OYairNw0bC7U8shJ6QqZbkosfAnPRfVHgz3LcZRpr2AexDurpwaArFAEALw_wcB&quot;&gt;not a straight-forward condition to define&lt;/a&gt;; it encompasses widely varying levels of ‘functional’ abilities - for example cognitive, physical, social, spatial etc - as well as many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is/related-conditions.aspx&quot;&gt;related conditions&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;em&gt;Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dyslexia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dyspraxia&lt;/em&gt;. If a market exists, as apparently it does, then it will be my job to find my own niches if I am am to enter into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;furthering-the-opportunities-for-research-into-virtual-reality-and-autism-the-falmouth-creative-app-development-ma-community-steps-in&quot;&gt;Furthering the opportunities for research into virtual reality and autism (the Falmouth &lt;em&gt;Creative App Development MA&lt;/em&gt; community steps in)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if to demonstrate the importance, to the lone creative app developer, of &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt; - discussed in week ten, &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/04/30/week-ten-who-else-is-making-apps.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;who else is making apps?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - I was offered some food for thought and some useful advice by my peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Jamie White enquired as to whether I would consider doing a PHD in order to do further research in the field. My answer is that, whilst it is not something I have seriously considered up to now, it does have an appeal. A major concern would be how it would be funded but, if I am able to do so satisfactorily, it could be something that I would give full due consideration. I was suggested by one of my peers that, in the meantime, if I were able to identify a market and start producing products that I am capable of creating now, I could focus on that market, getting to know it intimately whilst supplying and developing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is now something I am thinking about. Potentially, I could begin planning now and start putting out small-scale apps into the existing autism apps market. Over time this market would become one that I get to know and understand and whose needs I could attempt to satisfy. If virtual reality really does have a future in the field of autism, I would be in a strong position to find out and formulate a plan to enter into it, maybe even to play a part in its creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\webvr-logo-square-small.png&quot; alt=&quot;WebVR Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of my interest in Virtual Reality, I intend exploring its potential as a web-based technology. I understand this is some way off being a common and well-supported platform for VR - &lt;a href=&quot;https://webvr.info/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WebVR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is currently not available on all browsers and mobile device screens do not yet have the framerates or high resolution associated with more powerful platforms. But, as an emerging technology, it’s something I believe is worth following. The power of the web is partly its ability to democratise technology and make it available to more people - something that could seriously help VR find a place within autism therapy and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\pe-pyramid.png&quot; alt=&quot;WebVR in action&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the twelve weeks of my MA journey so far, with sincerity I feel able to say, &lt;em&gt;‘I have travelled a long way’&lt;/em&gt;. The course lectures, interviews and the subjects they have introduced have provided the information and context for me to reflect on and to develop my ideas. Material has been provided in order to inform and encourage consideration of commercial aspects, potential markets, the types of app that exist in these markets and audience development. I have begun gaining a more developed sense of the kind of work being done in different areas of app development, such as with emerging technologies, and have thoroughly enjoyed discussing creative practice, management of the creative process and the concept of creativity itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the most pertinent aspect of my journey so far has been that I have begun forming an idea of potential pathways for myself. I have identified education gaming as an interesting way of enhancing the learning process with fun and creativity and found the prospect of using virtual and augmented reality, in educational games and experience, to be thought provoking. In particular, I have identified the use of VR in the field of ASD therapy and research as an exciting and personally-interesting area to possibly take further, with a view to entering the market and maybe playing a role in its development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In The Beginning</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week Twelve - Pre-history (from there to here)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/05/04/week-twelve-2-pre-history.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week Twelve - Pre-history (from there to here)" /><published>2019-05-04T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/05/04/week-twelve-2-pre-history</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/05/04/week-twelve-2-pre-history.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:block;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;\images\pathway-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pathway&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;on-commencing-the-ma-in-creative-app-development&quot;&gt;On commencing the MA in Creative App Development…&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-did-not-know-exactly-what-path-i-was-going-to-follow&quot;&gt;      I did not know exactly what path I was going to follow…&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-did-not-have-a-well-formed-idea-of-a-destination&quot;&gt;            I did not have a well-formed idea of a destination…&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did know something about the new technologies driving the industry, of web development.. and beyond.. and wished to &lt;strong&gt;know them all&lt;/strong&gt;: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;real-time push capabilities provided by the advent of node.js&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;client-powered single page websites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;native and cross-platform mobile development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;machine learning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cloud storage and related technologies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Big Data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and so on…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I felt the need to get to know more about these&lt;/strong&gt; – and still do – but I was not part of an environment in which I was easily able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have no formal qualifications in the area of computers, software development, mathematics or science. Most of my colleagues seemed to come from one of these areas and I felt I would benefit from learning and solidifying my knowledge and skills, as well as providing a boost for my CV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-ealy-years&quot;&gt;My ealy years&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My background, academically at least, is in the arts – particularly music – although I have always been interested in technology generally and computers specifically. I taught myself to code back in the early 80s through studying listings in magazines and trying simple ideas out on the ZX81 on display in my local WHSmiths. Progress continued on my ZX Spectrum and later a BBC Micro, which I regard as the greatest learning tool in history!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music played a massive part in my life growing up, but I appeared to be following a likely career path in software development, until a late and protracted period of uncertainty ended with me throwing my energy into the arts. Firstly, I studied A level art in night-class, followed by a foundation year at art college. I then moved into music, working in a recording studio, managing a jazz club, playing in bands and completing a BA (hons) in Music, specialising in Performance Technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-professional-life&quot;&gt;My professional life&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since finishing my degree, I have found my computer-related hobby gradually increasing to become my profession, whilst my career in the arts has conversely become an impassioned hobby. Post-BA, I began work assessing small-scale funding applications for the Arts Council of England’s lottery-funded &lt;em&gt;Arts 4 Everyone&lt;/em&gt; scheme. During this time, I took on the administration of the scheme’s database, eventually moving fully into database development as a freelancer, the intention being to fund my main career as a creator of music and art. Over time, it became easier to find work as a developer than commissions as a composer, and the respective levels of remuneration caused the proportion of my time spent on these areas to increase in favour of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;here-i-am&quot;&gt;Here I am&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, when I first saw the title of the this MA - &lt;em&gt;Creative App Development&lt;/em&gt; - I was immediately struck by the way the combination of these words seemed to encompass everything I wished to learn and achieve in my professional life; they instilled in me a deep-seated desire to somehow find a way on to the course. If I was not able to do so, at least I knew that such things exist. A spark had been ignited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, with perfect timing, I was made redundant! I was given enough money by my former employer to fund my place on the MA and to tide me over for a while until I found my next day job, which I began exactly two weeks before I embarked on my new life as a Falmouth distance-learning MA student. I could not have been happier!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">On commencing the MA in Creative App Development…</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week Eleven - How Do We Plan and Manage Larger Creative App Development Projects?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/05/01/week-eleven-project-planning.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week Eleven - How Do We Plan and Manage Larger Creative App Development Projects?" /><published>2019-05-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/05/01/week-eleven-project-planning</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/05/01/week-eleven-project-planning.html">&lt;p&gt;This week we look at the two main methods used for managing large creative development projects: the age-old &lt;em&gt;Waterfall&lt;/em&gt; model and the more modern &lt;em&gt;Scrum&lt;/em&gt; methodology, which is one of a number of approaches that sit under the umbrella philosophy, &lt;em&gt;Agile&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a term, the &lt;em&gt;Waterfall&lt;/em&gt; methodology is something I’ve only recently come across, although it describes the way things were generally done from at least the 1970s (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘waterfall model’&lt;/em&gt;, wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;). Things began to change after the authoring, in 2001, of the Agile Manifesto (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘what is agile?’&lt;/em&gt;, agile alliance&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-experience&quot;&gt;Personal experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;waterfall&quot;&gt;Waterfall&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\waterfall.png&quot; alt=&quot;waterfall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My earliest development projects were extremely loose in their definition – I was the sole developer and did not really embrace any particular methodology; in many respects, I was really just &lt;em&gt;making it up&lt;/em&gt; as I went along. However, the way I worked was probably closer to the Waterfall model than an Agile one as, in extremely simplified terms, I would agree with my client an initial and reasonably coherent idea of how we envisaged the end result and I would go away and build it. When the product was ready it would be presented to the client, it would be accepted, my invoice would be honoured, and that was pretty much the end of the matter. Admittedly, it wasn’t quite as simple as that and there would have been plenty of dialogue and contact with the client during the development process, as well as bugs to iron out after deployment, but it was essentially a process that followed a direct linear route from initial planning to finished product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one of my projects - a subscriptions management system for a religious magazine - encountered a problem - one that I imagine could typically be associated with the Waterfall approach but should never happen under an Agile model: the product was taking longer than had initially been estimated and the budget had long since been used up! Either I starved, defaulted on my extortionate London-size rent, or I would have to approach my client and ask for more money so as to produce a finished product. I chose that latter option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had agreed a budget with my client, a company director, which had been approved by the board. But he now had to re-approach the board, cap in hand, asking for more money to be released. I distinctly remember the embarrassment of having to admit we’d - &lt;em&gt;I’d&lt;/em&gt; - made a mistake and that the only way round this was for me to either finish the project by working on the latter stages for free, or for us to agree a way forward that involved some re-working of the budget on the part of the client. Issues of trust and reputation were at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;scrum&quot;&gt;Scrum&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\scrum.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scrum&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;scrum&lt;/em&gt; methodology would have avoided this extremely awkward situation because we would have continually been assessing and re-evaluating progress, addressing issues as the product developed, iteratively, over a sequence of manageable sprints. It may still have been the case that we had got the initial estimated budget wrong, and this would have remained an issue that needed dealing with, but it would have been highly unlikely that we would have arrived at a point where a bombshell had to be dropped and the only two possible resolutions were almost unpalatable, either to the developer or the client. Instead, under an agile approach, decisions could have been made either to reflect the changing situation with amendments and actions at the sprint-planning stage, or revisions to budgets and management of expectations could have been controlled more easily, sensitively and democratically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was, the board agreed an extension and an increased budget, but I was still left knowing that I never want to find myself in this position again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years later, when working as part of an Agile team using the scrum methodology, I saw at first-hand how a project can be developed from an initial plan and realised as a released product, over any number of continual iterations, via a process that allows unexpected hitches and changes of client requirements to be dealt with as they arise. Rather than being subject to updated requirements at the &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of the project’s development lifecycle, and potentially being adversely affected by changes to, as in this case for example, the pre-determined budget set for a monolithic end product, individual sprints facilitate the ability to react to events and situations as they arise, and projects can be designed in such a way as to allow any potential blows to be greatly lessened or removed entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;planning-an-agile-project-using-scrum&quot;&gt;Planning an Agile Project Using Scrum&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As outlined above, being aware of the benefits of Agile and the pitfalls of a non-agile approach, I am keen to embrace this approach, in particular &lt;em&gt;scrum&lt;/em&gt;, as a model for planning my projects. I will create a SMART goal to begin planning the continuing progress of my App Jam word-game project using scrum as the template for defining a Product Backlog and the first Sprint Backlog. This will form the basis from which the project will continue as I move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Specific:&lt;/strong&gt; So that I can continue to work on its development in a flexible, iterative way in line with Agile practice and ideology, my goal is to set up my App Jam word game project using the Scrum methodology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Measurable:&lt;/strong&gt; I will create Product Backlog items (as User Stories) for the work I know I need to get done and set up my first sprint in a ready-to-go state.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Attainable:&lt;/strong&gt; This will be achieved within a single sprint planning session.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Relevant:&lt;/strong&gt; I will be able to make an immediate start on continuing my project work as soon as I am able to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Time-Based:&lt;/strong&gt; I will allow a maximum of three hours for the sprint planning session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used my experience of working under a model similar to a &lt;em&gt;Waterfall&lt;/em&gt; methodology in order to contrast it with my experience of working in an &lt;em&gt;Agile Scrum&lt;/em&gt; environment. In so doing, I have shown how the kind of problems I experienced, that are associated with the older model, should not be possible under the more modern Agile approach. I’ve then created a SMART goal to define the development of my App Jam word game project using Scrum methodologies. When I am in a position to do so, I will use this plan as I move forward with my project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This week we look at the two main methods used for managing large creative development projects: the age-old Waterfall model and the more modern Scrum methodology, which is one of a number of approaches that sit under the umbrella philosophy, Agile.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week Ten - Who Else is Making Apps and What Approaches Do they Use?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/04/30/week-ten-who-else-is-making-apps.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week Ten - Who Else is Making Apps and What Approaches Do they Use?" /><published>2019-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/04/30/week-ten-who-else-is-making-apps</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/04/30/week-ten-who-else-is-making-apps.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\communities-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Communities of Practice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communities-of-practice&quot;&gt;Communities of Practice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movements and Professional Bodies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have been slightly reluctant to entertain the idea of hitching myself up with an established &lt;strong&gt;professional body&lt;/strong&gt;. I have always considered them to be for &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; developers who were perhaps more concerned about their career than their ‘art’. I was also probably put off, during my years as a self-employed developer, by the fact that they generally require a membership fee and demand more of my time and effort than I felt I was able to give or able to cash in on when I needed to get something out. Perhaps I have always had a bit of the Groucho Marx &lt;em&gt;“I don’t want to belong to any club that would accept me as one of its members”&lt;/em&gt; attitude. It could be viewed as a little irrational but, nonetheless, I do have an aversion to belonging to recognised groups or clubs. In any case, for the years I have not been self-employed, most of the support I needed has been gained from working as part of a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movements&lt;/strong&gt; are quite different in my view, as they have come about through a genuine shared aspiration to drive a particular passion or practice in a particular direction, to use the collective will of multiple like-minded people to further ideas and make a genuine and recognisable difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-hacker-and-maker-movements&quot;&gt;The Hacker and Maker Movements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of software systems to achieve novel and clever outcomes. The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed “hacking”.&lt;br /&gt;
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture&quot;&gt;‘hacker culture’ - wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The maker movement … is the umbrella term for independent inventors, designers and tinkerers. A convergence of computer hackers and traditional artisans, the niche is established enough to have its own magazine, Make, as well as hands-on Maker Faires that are catnip for DIYers who used to toil in solitude.&lt;br /&gt;
– &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/104210/maker-faire-maker-movement/&quot;&gt;time.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\maker-movement-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Maker Movement&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maker culture&lt;/em&gt; intersects with &lt;em&gt;hacker culture&lt;/em&gt;. Both share a DIY, &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/&quot;&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt; ethos but, whereas hacker culture is concerned primarily with software, maker culture is more engineering-oriented, interested in such pursuits as electronics, robotics and 3D printing [&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture&quot;&gt;‘maker culture’ - wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities of practice and communities of interest tend to pop up around such movements. Without making much of a real effort to associate myself with a specific community, it’s fair to say that at various times I have existed on the fringes of several - &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlservercentral.com/&quot;&gt;SQLServerCentral&lt;/a&gt; spring to mind. This has been generally unintentional and borne out of necessity, for, without the knowledge, advice and support they can provide, I would have struggled to achieve much.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\stackoverflow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stack Overflow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… by programmers, for programmers, with the ultimate intent of collectively increasing the sum total of good programming knowledge in the world. No matter what programming language you use, or what operating system you call home. Better programming is our goal.&lt;br /&gt;
– &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.codinghorror.com/introducing-stackoverflow-com/&quot;&gt;codinghorror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life as a developer would be very difficult without StackOverflow. Most coding-related queries put out as Google searches return a number of possible answers from the forum, via the same or similar questions having already been asked by its members. Over the years it has become clear just how precious this resource is for those who have become involved. The expected, or even &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; etiquette - an important feature of belonging to such a community - is so passionately enforced and the rewards, in terms of &lt;strong&gt;reputation&lt;/strong&gt; points and virtual &lt;strong&gt;medals&lt;/strong&gt;, so sought-after, that I am sometimes surprised at the fervour with which they are gathered. Kudos is very highly prized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week’s article on Communities of Practice, Alcwyn Parker advises identifying a potential &lt;em&gt;mentor&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;role model&lt;/em&gt; to aid integration. I have seen this at work first-hand: a recent new colleague of mine, who will happily tell you that he is very much part of the stack overflow community, has demonstrated the importance the community’s particular etiquette, in terms of methods and expectations for posting and answering questions and ensuring that your own questions receive the best response possible in super-quick time by offering virtual ‘bounty’ for the most useful answer. It’s easy to see how such a community can form and grow together as it develops its own social culture, including rules and accepted etiquette that help to define itself and legitimise its existence, to set it out to be unique and ‘owned’ by the community members themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Legitimation in the social sciences refers to the process whereby an act, process, or ideology becomes legitimate by its attachment to norms and values within a given society. It is the process of making something acceptable and normative to a group or audience.&lt;br /&gt;
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimation&quot;&gt;‘legitimation’ - wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a community that plays an important part in making information available and providing support along with the benefit of experience. The sense of community and of belonging is vital in achieving its inherently altruistic aims, which are borne of a desire to share and constantly improve the quality of knowledge and developmental practice generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-falmouth-creative-app-development-community&quot;&gt;The Falmouth ‘Creative App Development’ Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\falmouth-banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Falmouth 'Creative App Development' Community&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on how my own ideas have developed and expanded in the short time I’ve been on this MA course, I can see that I have moved from a fairly narrow idea of the possible direction of my personal development, towards one that is beginning to encompass a wider set of possibilities. This is partly due to the sharing of knowledge and experience between practitioners - students, academic staff, external or loosely-affiliated contributors - who are, in their own ways, following personal, loosely-related paths and have come to form a community of sorts, at least partly unintentionally. As I have become less isolated from outside and diversified influences, my general outlook has begun moving away from the idea that my creative future lies almost solely in web development and, although the web is very likely to remain important to me, I have been increasingly made aware of other attractions and areas of potential interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is unlikely to have happened without coming to ‘belong’ to a group that share interests and ambitions as creative app developers. Following this train of thought, I can see that intentionally associating myself with groups, communities and movements, with similar interests, goals and aspirations, can potentially provide fuel for driving the further development of ideas and skills, whilst providing the support that can be vital when following a path that is actually quite personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;researching-communities&quot;&gt;Researching communities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I do not have much knowledge or experience of the various communities and associated events or activities associated with the Hacker and Maker movements, I would like to find out more and get some idea of those I may be interested in involving myself with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also find myself drawn to the interests and ethea inherent in the maker movement.  Although I have no direct experience, I find the potential of playing with the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms and, in particular, getting involved with electronics and robotics, to be very appealing. To this end, I will create a SMART goal to undergo research into relevant and interesting Hacker and Maker communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Specific:&lt;/strong&gt; The goal is to research Hacker and Maker movement communities and select those that appear to be aligned with my own interests and goals, as well as offering potential for expanding into new personal territories.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Measurable:&lt;/strong&gt; I will document my research and my conclusions and create a journal entry. Where necessary, I will contact the most interesting groups for further information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Attainable:&lt;/strong&gt; This will be achieved within a single week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Relevant:&lt;/strong&gt; At the end of this process, I will have learned more about the types of communities that exist and have a list of those that I find to be personally interesting and which I may involve myself with. I will have been in contact with those that are most interesting to me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Time-Based:&lt;/strong&gt; I will devote three sessions to this: one for research, another for drawing up conclusions and another for writing a journal and contacting those of greatest interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have discussed my interest in the Hacker and Maker movements and the kinds of communities that are associated with them. I have used my experience with &lt;em&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/em&gt; as an example of how such a community can operate and achieve its aims. I’ve also looked at how a &lt;em&gt;creative app development&lt;/em&gt; community has emerged from the shared interests of my fellow students, academic staff and contributors at Falmouth and seen how this has begun to change and expand my interests and horizons in terms of my own developmental pathway. Finally, I have created a SMART goal to undergo research into relevant communities of practice and to begin getting involved with any that are of particular interest to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week Ten - Report on Continuing Personal and Professional Development</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/04/29/week-ten-report-on-continuing-personal-professional-development.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week Ten - Report on Continuing Personal and Professional Development" /><published>2019-04-29T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-04-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/04/29/week-ten-report-on-continuing-personal-professional-development</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/04/29/week-ten-report-on-continuing-personal-professional-development.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\personal-development-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Personal Development&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I embarked on the MA with no formal qualifications in software development. Although I am in possession of a reasonably wide-ranging experience, having built up a ‘full stack’ of internet development skills, including database development, data analysis, business intelligence, .NET MVC, C# and JavaScript, this has been gained through experience whilst working in the field of education data analysis. Of these skills, it is the front-end, client-side, user-interactive variety with which I am less familiar or confident, but they are the ones I am most interested in pursuing: I want to make web-based apps that are engaging, visual and experientially-stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first degree is a BA in Music, with Visual Performance as a minor, and I always felt lacking in some of the rudiments of software development in comparison with my computer science graduate colleagues.  However, I also felt the urge to combine my enjoyment of coding with my appetite for creativity and an interest in on-going developments within creative technology. The MA in Creative App Development appealed as it looked like it would help me to develop creatively, beyond the limitations of my career as a developer up to this point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the course is providing me with a framework for thinking about the process of creative development and the industry itself, whilst challenging me to find a pathway for my own personal and professional development. The goals I have set myself combine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the need to develop specific technical skills,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;market research, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;studying methods for managing the process of creative development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is my background in both education data analysis and the creative industry, but I have found myself to be comfortable thinking in terms of game-focused education tools as a niche to explore. I also have a personal interest in development of Autism apps, having a son diagnosed with autism, who is home-schooled in a programme we, as a family, are heavily involved in delivering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that this course will help me realise my ambition, which is to start a business of my own, creating intelligent, useful and innovative apps that play a small part in moving the industry forwards. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-and-project-management&quot;&gt;Time and Project Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\time-management.png&quot; alt=&quot;Time Management&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal I outlined in my PCS referred to problems I have finding periods of quality, uninterrupted time, and my desire to ‘negotiate’ such periods with my family.  Reflecting on this, I am somewhat resigned to working around and within the activity and mechanics of everyday family life. My situation has made me think about how I can reduce the importance of the actual amount of time available.  I do not view project and time management as a strength and understand it would be extremely beneficial to work at this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a suggestion in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dansilvestre.com/time-management-techniques/&quot;&gt;dansilvestre.com&lt;/a&gt;, I intend to create a time management ‘rule book’, which will contain a list of documented techniques that can be used on an everyday basis, in order to assist focusing on productivity whilst reducing the negative impacts of tiredness and stress. Many example strategies exist, such as the twenty-two listed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.proofhub.com/articles/time-management-strategies&quot;&gt;proofhub.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have begun using the &lt;strong&gt;Pomodoro&lt;/strong&gt; technique, which has been shown to support better productivity and greater learning ability (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://naturalfactors.com/en-us/articles/manage-stress-pomodoro-technique/&quot;&gt;naturalfactors&lt;/a&gt;). I have found breaking up my working time into short sessions to be beneficial, allowing me to maintain freshness of thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On peer recommendation, I have obtained a copy of &lt;em&gt;Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-free Productivity&lt;/em&gt; by David Allen, which I will be studying over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be employing the central tenets of &lt;strong&gt;Agile&lt;/strong&gt;, in particular, methodologies related to &lt;em&gt;Scrum&lt;/em&gt;; that is, working incrementally and iteratively in short, fixed-length &lt;em&gt;sprints&lt;/em&gt;, allowing regular reflection and encouraging response to any lessons learned. For several years, I worked in an Agile development environment as part of a ‘self-organizing’ team (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/&quot;&gt;agilealliance.org&lt;/a&gt;). But agile methodologies are also relevant when working as an individual (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/what-is-agile-scrum-methodology&quot;&gt;lucidchart.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond software development and general project management, Agile techniques are now also becoming recognised as a way for individuals to manage their personal lives. It may be that Agile will seamlessly inform my work-life balance entirely: –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Working from a prioritized product backlog, breaking work into iterations, limiting work in progress, and regular reflection are just some of the concepts borrowed from agile that people can use to better manage their personal lives.&lt;br /&gt;
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/personal-scrum-using-agile-techniques-manage-your-life&quot;&gt;techbeacon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;smart-goal--&quot;&gt;SMART Goal: -&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific:&lt;/strong&gt; The goal is to create a time-management rule book, which will define the rules that I will use in project management and my day-to-day life and use Agile methodologies to manage my development process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable:&lt;/strong&gt; I will find ten time-management techniques that I believe will work for me. I will place all my current goals into my Kanban board.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attainable:&lt;/strong&gt; My ten rules will be assessed daily and kept or discarded depending on their success or failure, which I will document in my journal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relevant:&lt;/strong&gt; Management of my time, work and study practice are essential if I am to create a sustainable and satisfactory work-life balance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-based:&lt;/strong&gt; I will have my rule book and Kanban board fully set up by the end of Module 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;market-research&quot;&gt;Market Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\market-research.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Market Research&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From not having a firm idea of my direction at the start of the course, as a main driving force I am becoming interested in &lt;strong&gt;education apps&lt;/strong&gt;, with Autism as a possible area for specialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how someone with autism views and responds to the world is quite a challenge, as is teaching a child to learn what everyone else takes for granted as part of normal development and learned behaviour.  Areas that can be identified as requiring specific and targeted input, such as understanding facial expressions or developing fine motor skills, could potentially be addressed in interesting and playful ways through the medium of an app. Some interesting work has been done in these areas: for example, an app to help practice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.educationalappstore.com/app/training-faces-1&quot;&gt;emotion and facial recognition&lt;/a&gt;, reading facial expressions using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/900519&quot;&gt;Google Glass&lt;/a&gt;, practicing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastersealstech.com/2015/04/01/10-apps-for-practicing-motor-skills/&quot;&gt;motor skills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apps that address teaching skills to people with autism or attempt to tap into the way the world is viewed by autistic people, I feel, could potentially be highly creative, with scope for an experimental approach to interacting with and creating worlds through the use of &lt;strong&gt;Virtual&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Augmented Reality&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;..people with autism are using VR to convey their own experiences, both to raise awareness of the condition and to capture the cognitive and perceptual differences that characterize it.&lt;br /&gt;
– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/virtual-reality-transforming-autism-studies/&quot;&gt;spectrumnews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have a personal interest in autism, I feel it would be beneficial to understand the education app market generally. I would also like to observe and get a feel for the market for experimental and art-based apps, particularly those that explore ideas related to sensorial experience and that could open potential spaces for autistic minds to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;smart-goal---1&quot;&gt;SMART Goal: -&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific:&lt;/strong&gt; The goal is to investigate app stores at Apple, Google and Microsoft, to research literature and other relevant media, and to create a spreadsheet comprising existing apps and developments within the areas of education, education games and autism-focused apps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable:&lt;/strong&gt; Results of my research will be stored in a spreadsheet and I will write a journal entry outlining and responding to my findings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attainable:&lt;/strong&gt; This information will be available via targeted searches on the internet, such as app stores, articles, forums and other media. Examples have been shown to exist.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relevant:&lt;/strong&gt; Once I have an understanding of what apps exists and the niches they occupy, I will be able to begin formulating my own plans for entering the market myself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-based:&lt;/strong&gt; I expect the research and creation of the database to take 4-5 hours and the journal entry to take another 2 hours – so a solid working day in total.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2d-animation&quot;&gt;2D Animation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\2d-animation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2D Animation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the outset, I was interested in user-experience and, considering my interest in game-focused, interactive education apps, I see game-oriented animation as an integral part of a skill-set necessary to create polished, professional looking and highly playable games in order to move into these markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to use my app jam word game project, which is essentially a two-dimensional arcade-style game with an educational leaning, as a vehicle to experiment with specifically game-focused animation rendering. My work using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pixijs.com&quot;&gt;pixijs.com&lt;/a&gt; animation library has been a useful point of entry into the use of JavaScript animation libraries, and I wish to continue the process of familiarising myself with game development, through integrating graphics rendered using a tool designed specifically for building games, and which leverage the power of &lt;strong&gt;Canvas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;WebGL&lt;/strong&gt; in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have investigated opinions expressed in online forums and by peers and read reviews and articles discussing the subject. This research has indicated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phaser.io&quot;&gt;phaser.io&lt;/a&gt; to be a suitable tool with which to begin my explorations. My hope is that the quality of the results will help realise the potential of my word game to develop into what, I believe, could be a future commercial product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;strong&gt;Angular&lt;/strong&gt; framework for the App Jam project, partly because I’d already started learning it prior to the course, but also due to its use as a basis for at least two cross-platform mobile development frameworks - &lt;strong&gt;NativeScript&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ionic&lt;/strong&gt; –  both of which I am interested in investigating in the future. This required adapting the pure JavaScript of the PixiJS documentation and examples into TypeScript. I found this not to have been much of a hindrance. My goal is to add Phaser to my Angular boilerplate so as to be available, alongside PixiJs, in my future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;smart-goal---2&quot;&gt;SMART Goal: -&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific:&lt;/strong&gt; The goal is to integrate the Phaser game framework into my Angular boilerplate and demonstrate its use within my App Jam word game.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable:&lt;/strong&gt; Once integrated, to prove its suitability I will use Phaser to drive one feature of the word game’s game-play.  I will document the process in an entry in my Creative Reflective Journal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attainable:&lt;/strong&gt; I will devote a two-week sprint to this, immediately after I have completed all course work and journal entries for the current module.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relevant:&lt;/strong&gt; I will add Phaser to my Angular boilerplate and prove it to work in tandem with PixiJS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-based:&lt;/strong&gt; I will begin a two-week sprint devoted to this goal once I have completed the current module’s course work and journal entries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;websockets-and-cloud-technologies&quot;&gt;WebSockets and Cloud Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\websockets.png&quot; alt=&quot;WebSockets&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having grown up with computers existing largely as separate entities and then the promise of the internet frustrated by the laborious request/response paradigm of HTTP, I was excited when I first became aware of the prospect of almost instantaneous interactions between people, computers and software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some time, I’ve been considering how I could make use of &lt;strong&gt;WebSockets&lt;/strong&gt;. Most of my initial ideas fell roughly into the domain of social media. However, in relation to the kind of education apps I am now considering, a powerful feature would be for real-time interactions and collaborations between students, teachers, classmates and parents etc.  Alongside full duplex connectivity, I would like to make the most of advancements within cloud technologies, such as flexible online storage and serverless functions (for example Amazon AWS and Firebase). In terms of my word game app, the use of these could include the following: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drawing on saved states from previous sessions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mapping progress over time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting up scenarios and challenges in advance of the next session&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flexibility of location, platform or device&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Common processes undertaken by microservices hosted in the cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, I envisage my planned education game apps taking on some of the technical aspects used in &lt;strong&gt;multi-player games&lt;/strong&gt;. I would like to undertake a feasibility study and devise a plan for turning my App Jam word-game into a multi-player game. The plan would use WebSockets to facilitate communication between players, cloud-based storage to maintain game state and record achievement, and serverless functions to manage aspects of game-play such as ‘dealing’ words to the players. I believe these technologies are freely available and, individually, not too difficult to master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;smart-goal---3&quot;&gt;SMART Goal: -&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific:&lt;/strong&gt; The goal is to create a concept and technical ‘blueprint’ of the structure of my App Jam word-game realised as a multi-player game&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable:&lt;/strong&gt; The document will comprise diagrams, charts and explanations that sets out the entire model.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attainable:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to create this over one week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relevant:&lt;/strong&gt; The blueprint will be such that it will enable me to make an immediate start on modifying the existing app and implementing new features.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-based:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to use three sessions on successive days - the first for research of technologies, the second to develop my findings and to draw up a prototype, and the third to finalise the concept as a complete blueprint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;music-and-sound&quot;&gt;Music and Sound&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\computer-music.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Music and Sound&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the part played by sound in media experiences is often under-valued. As a musician and creator of music and sound art, I would like to see sound placed on an equal footing with visual aspects. At some point I would like to make creative apps where sound is the main driving force. Such apps could be in the form of sound-led &lt;strong&gt;experimental art apps&lt;/strong&gt;, such as &lt;em&gt;Bjork’s Biophilia&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;synthPond&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Zach Gage&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;music education&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;music-game&lt;/strong&gt; apps, such as &lt;em&gt;Dust Buster app for Piano&lt;/em&gt; or music puzzle games like &lt;em&gt;Tapt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have extensive experience of creating music, both acoustically and electronically and, having also flirted with being a visual artist, I am particularly interested in the &lt;strong&gt;cross-overs&lt;/strong&gt; that can flourish between sonic and other creative activities, as demonstrated in my BA degree in Music, in which I minored in Visual Performance, and having since worked collaboratively in the production of multi-disciplinary installation, contemporary dance, film and theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, music has played less of a dominant role as a creative activity. Whereas I once co-ran a DIY electronica music label and was continually producing and performing, I think I would now struggle to create and output at a similar level of intensity and my confidence in my ability to do so has consequently dipped. However, I am not downhearted about this, as software development has in large part taken over.  I now intend to phase in, over the course of my development, the use of sound in increasingly interesting and creative ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;playback of recorded and sampled sound&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;attachment of sound to events, such as those driven by user interaction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;streaming sound across an internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sound creation - via synthesis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sound manipulation - effects etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, more immediately, I would like to concentrate on adding sound to my App Jam word game in order to make it a more “immersive and emotionally-charged experience” (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amplifon.ie/resources/playing-with-your-mind/&quot;&gt;amplifon.ie&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;smart-goal---4&quot;&gt;SMART Goal: -&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific:&lt;/strong&gt; The goal is to add basic sound to my word game project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable:&lt;/strong&gt; I need sounds for the following events: collisions (both positive and negative), game over, level completed and background soundtrack. The goal will be complete once I have these basic sounds satisfactorily in place.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attainable:&lt;/strong&gt; I am competent in creating sounds and music as well as having access to online sound effects libraries. I will use online resources to study how to add sound to events in JavaScript and as a continual soundtrack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relevant:&lt;/strong&gt; The game requires these sounds in place to improve the overall quality, playability and to enhance the user-experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-based:&lt;/strong&gt; I will use three sessions on consecutive days: the first to creating my app jam sound library, the second for research and learning  and the third for implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most useful things I have learned has been the importance of constantly reacting to my achievements and failures and assessing what I have learned from them.  This has led me to continually re-appraise the goals I have set myself and helped me move forward in terms of my ideas, expectations and ambitions.  As a result, rather than tie my goals down to their initial incarnations, I have allowed them to evolve naturally so that they can better suit what I have learned since they were first put onto paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through reflection, I have also found that game-focused education apps and, specifically, autism related apps have become interesting to me. In particular due to my personal interests due to having an autistic son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel confident that continuing to take this approach will ultimately lead me to success in my chosen fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week Nine - Which Technologies Can Empower Creativity?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/04/19/week-nine-emerging-tech.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week Nine - Which Technologies Can Empower Creativity?" /><published>2019-04-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-04-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/04/19/week-nine-emerging-tech</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/04/19/week-nine-emerging-tech.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\creativity-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Creativity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we are looking at emerging technologies - i.e. technologies that have not yet appeared in the markets or are in the stages of early adoption. In particular, we were are interested in how they can drive and empower the creative process and facilitate &lt;em&gt;Disruptive Practice&lt;/em&gt; - i.e. the shaking-up of the market by forcing a divergence from established genres patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a series of video interviews comprising viewpoints from a selection of academic practitioners who are undergoing research and practical work within areas being opened up by new technologies, we are provided with a fascinating insight into the kind of work being done when investigating and exploring the creative possibilities facilitated by such technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The six topics discussed are: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computational Creativity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Dr Simon Colton - professor of Digital Games Technology at Falmouth University Games Academy)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in an attempt to &lt;em&gt;‘engineer software to take on creative responsibility so that it appears to be creative’&lt;/em&gt;. This is, in extremely short form, making software for creating, or aiding the creation of, music, art, video games etc. In so doing, fundamental philosophical questions are raised about the meaning of creativity itself, when software is actively producing in a field considered to be almost entirely occupied by humanity itself. Dr Simon Colton refers to &lt;em&gt;‘the notion of essentially contested concepts’&lt;/em&gt; (William Galley, 1954), in which there is no such thing as &lt;em&gt;being creative&lt;/em&gt; as it is, essentially, a subjective concept.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robotics and Artificial Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Rob Saunders - associate professor in Computational Creativity in the Meta Makers Institute at Falmouth University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rob Saunders, who is also involved in research into Computational Creativity, discusses ‘the computational modelling of curiosity’, building ‘curious agents’, allowing them to interact and then watching and studying what happens. Curiosity and boredom are the two, opposite, players in this scenario. Robotics feature heavily in Rob Saunders’ work, particularly in exploring the potential and problems for communication between people and non-humanoid robots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial Intelligence for Assisted Game Design&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Mark Nelson - Senior Research Fellow, Falmouth University)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Mark Nelson is involved in developing tools for creativity using devices such as phones and tablets, where space for interfaces is at a premium and the devices are used in a different kind of way to a PC. In particular, he is interested in how AI and generative technologies can assist the process of design on these kinds of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Algorithms&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Swen Gaudl - research fellow at the MetaMakers Institute)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Using data gathered from human players in order to design and enhance AI game or robotic characters, the idea is to mimic human characteristics and to create AI game players that are not optimal, or perfect, but instead they play with skill at the level of the human player and behave like a human. This approach is different to ‘black box’ solutions, such as neuro-networks or Monte Carlo Tree Search (see below), which attempt to produce optimal results and methods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wearable Technology&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Lucie Hernandez - fulltime PhD student at Falmouth University, studying Digital Craft)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Bringing together craft (physical materials such as fabrics, cloth, plywood etc.) and digital data and code, mainly using the Arduino platform (such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fityle-Lilypad-Arduino-Electronics-ATmega328P-Multicolor/dp/B07MHCYTJ3/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_2?adgrpid=52791724229&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwtYXmBRAOEiwAYsyl3JEkTAmppwsmPJDyodJhxkeE-vrExz41Eg7rj-cO54eozbNl-RYmmBoCrscQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;hvadid=259114555821&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9045354&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;amp;hvqmt=e&amp;amp;hvrand=7692690723801361337&amp;amp;hvtargid=kwd-379789791023&amp;amp;hydadcr=28208_1821145&amp;amp;keywords=lilypad+sewable+electronics+kit&amp;amp;qid=1556224765&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-2-fkmrnull&quot;&gt;LillyPad sewable electronics kit for Arduino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adafruit-GEMMA-v2-Miniature-electronic/dp/B01LWL30Y3/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=53910032380&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwtYXmBRAOEiwAYsyl3F-d4IsZ2giArPHKP6V1gFYm0MrfWULf2bdXcU9c0NHUQiGeOq3dRxoCwJkQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;hvadid=259088736472&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9045354&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvpos=1t2&amp;amp;hvqmt=e&amp;amp;hvrand=7612514833322170843&amp;amp;hvtargid=kwd-300151255810&amp;amp;hydadcr=4395_1734505&amp;amp;keywords=adafruit+gemma&amp;amp;qid=1556224928&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Adafruit Gemma&lt;/a&gt;) embedded in wearable garments and accessories). As an example, Lucie uses digital stitch to create ‘zones’ which respond to touch and, via LilyPad, control sound output. There are other controllers being developed by a vibrant e-textile community, such as neon pixels to control RGB colour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monte Carlo Tree Search&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Dr Ed Powley - lecturer in Computing for Games and researcher in the MetaMakers Institute, Falmouth University Games Academy)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Working with AI for the automatic creation and generation of games. The Monte Carlo Tree Search is a ‘black box’ AI algorithm that, in order to learn how to play a previously unknown game, starts with randomness and gradually sorts out the ‘good’ outcomes. The speed of modern computers allows the repetition of successful outcomes and the discarding of those that fail to happen very quickly. The algorithm is part of the ‘re-enforcement learning’ family, along with ‘Neuro-networks’ and &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/&quot;&gt;‘Google Deep Mind’&lt;/a&gt;, which famously had success with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2132086-deepminds-ai-beats-worlds-best-go-player-in-latest-face-off/&quot;&gt;‘Go’ board game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-response-to-this-weeks-material&quot;&gt;My response to this week’s material&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the videos give a sense of how, through the process of probing the boundaries of emerging technologies and exploring the potential breadth of possibilities, new space can be opened up for the development of creative ideas. In this way, creativity itself can be seen to be driven by the process of experimentation, the charting of previously unexplored territory revealing fertile ground for creative ideas to flourish. Potentially, the markets can be influenced to such an extent - as any benefits, improvements and a general desire for novelty and new ideas are embraced - that established norms and patterns are questioned, &lt;em&gt;disrupted&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology increases to be part of our daily lives and everyday existence. I suppose this is a continuation of the course of our on-going relationship with technology ever since its history began; from the advent of the earliest tools, we have surrounded ourselves with technologies and devices that not only make our lives easier, but increasingly define our world and influence our understanding of our place within it; through a constant process of scientific discovery and creative experimentation, the lines between what may be considered to be ‘natural’ and the world we have fabricated for ourselves, seem to be increasingly blurred. Recent developments and our subsequent reliance on connectivity, mobile and wearable technology and the increasingly significant part played in everyday life by artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining and robotics, appear to reinforce this impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;social robotics.. are going to account for about 70 percent of the robots in the world within the next 10 to 20 years. We’re looking at a lot of robots coming into the home - 
Rob Saunders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;virtual-reality--augmented-reality&quot;&gt;Virtual Reality &amp;amp; Augmented Reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\vr-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Virtual Reality&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;\images\ar-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Augmented Reality&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question that may be worth considering is, when does an emerging technology stop being an emerging technology? I began thinking this when considering the cases of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. Conceptually, they have both been around in some form or other for a while now. But then, so has Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today’s virtual reality technologies build upon ideas that date back to the 1800s, almost to the very beginning of practical photography… The use of the term “virtual reality,” however, was first used in the mid-1980s when Jaron Lanier, founder of VPL Research, began to develop the gear, including goggles and gloves, needed to experience what he called “virtual reality.” &lt;br /&gt; - 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fi.edu/virtual-reality/history-of-virtual-reality&quot;&gt;Frankin Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some respects, VR has been an ‘emerging technology’ for some time, and there have been various milestones along the way. That said, with products such as Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear, VR is now beginning to realise its potential and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vrs.org.uk/virtual-reality/history.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;finally answer the unfulfilled  promises made by virtual reality in the 1990s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that interest in VR has lulled on occasion, but it can be expected to increase as new uses are discovered and the markets respond by investing in them: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;New technologies need to go through several releases before the average person is attracted to them. It starts with the tech enthusiasts that need to have the latest and greatest gadget. Then businesses invest heavily, as they see strong early use cases. All that business investment creates a market demand, which brings more entrants into the field. And finally, there is a release good enough for the average person &lt;br /&gt; -
&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/our-future/why-virtual-reality-is-the-most-impactful-emerging-technology-f208ab0f14fe&quot;&gt;medium.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-could-vr--ar-relate-to-my-own-work&quot;&gt;How could VR &amp;amp; AR relate to my own work?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been considering the potential use of Virtual Reality and, maybe to a lesser extent, Augmented Reality, with regard to apps related to autism; both in terms of attempting to gain an understanding of the condition and also ‘therapeutically’ by, for instance, helping to find a way of relating to the world in a way that can be understood without the common issues of anxiety and stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/virtual-reality-transforming-autism-studies/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How virtual reality is transforming autism studies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, George Musser discusses the use of VR for addressing autism, including practical issues and ethical dilemmas: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Proponents of VR argue that no other medium comes as close to putting you in someone else’s shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A specific therapeutic use for VR - &lt;em&gt;Social Cognition&lt;/em&gt; - is discussed by Nathan Caruana and Jon Brock of Macquarie University : -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Until the past few years, research into social cognition — the psychology of human interaction — has been decidedly non-interactive. Participants looked at images of faces, read short stories about social scenarios, or watched videos of other people interacting. They didn’t actually interact with another person.. We need tests that allow us to precisely measure behaviour in complex, reciprocal social interactions. To achieve this goal, we and others are investigating the use of virtual-reality technology as a tool for research and, potentially, therapy. &lt;br /&gt; - 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrumnews.org/opinion/viewpoint/virtual-reality-yields-clues-social-difficulties-autism/&quot;&gt;How VR yields clues to social difficulties with autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These researchers use facial recognition to track eye movement in order to study eye and related social activity within a setting that has been artificially set up, that suits a pre-defined set of parameters and is used to inform an empirical test in order to better understand a specific area of cognitive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could also be worth exploring the potential of VR to recreate social interactions within a safe and controlled environment that reduces anxiety and sensory overload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from therapeutic uses for VR, perhaps software can help understand the ‘autistic mind’ and create &lt;strong&gt;stimulatory experiences&lt;/strong&gt; to suit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;potential-for-adoption-of-vr&quot;&gt;Potential for adoption of VR&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the use of VR in autism appears to have not yet been fully adopted, questions will need to be asked about the readiness and viability of the markets as they currently stand and, consequently, whether it is a market that can be unearthed or created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For all its apparent advantages, however, VR has yet to be rigorously tested as a therapeutic or research tool for autism. Several meta-analyses this year turned up comparatively few studies, and most had only a handful of participants and no control group. Newbutt and a colleague, for instance, found a total of six studies since 1990 that have tested head-mounted VR displays in students with autism. “There isn’t that much evidence to support the use of this yet” &lt;br /&gt; - 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/virtual-reality-transforming-autism-studies/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How virtual reality is transforming autism studies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, one would work and developing alongside someone who has first hand experience of autism, i.e. an autistic person: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Involving people with autism in research is key to its success. As virtual-reality technology improves and becomes increasingly affordable, the possibilities may be limited only by our collective imagination.&lt;br /&gt; - 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrumnews.org/opinion/viewpoint/virtual-reality-yields-clues-social-difficulties-autism/&quot;&gt;How VR yields clues to social difficulties with autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With VR becoming ever-more available and affordable - e.g. Google Cardboard - then this kind of experimentation with VR is becoming more realistic. However the difficulty is how to build and work with a market / audience?  So far, this work appears to be academic research only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;artificial-intelligence-and-biometrics&quot;&gt;Artificial intelligence and biometrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also worth considering is the use of &lt;strong&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;: can AI gather response from experiments in this area and generate new experiences accordingly? Perhaps this could involve delving into &lt;strong&gt;biometrics&lt;/strong&gt; and overlapping with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://quantifiedself.com/&quot;&gt;Quantified Self&lt;/a&gt; project. In this way, maybe the measurement of stress levels, in conjunction with VR, could be an area worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;researching-vr-for-autism&quot;&gt;Researching VR for Autism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having taken a cursory look at the potential of VR for autism-related apps, I would like to take a deeper dive into the current use of VR and other emerging technologies, including researching any articles or papers I can find that consider its potential. I would then like to explore and sketch out some ideas of my own, including my initial thoughts in terms of feasibility, practical issues, audience characteristics and potential markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Specific:&lt;/strong&gt; For possible future development I would like to begin sketching out ideas for apps that use VR and other emerging technologies that in some way address issues in relation to autism. The goal is to undertake in-depth research this area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Measurable:&lt;/strong&gt; I will collate my research in to a single document, and my own ideas I will put into a sketch-book format that I can easily return to and pick up at a future date.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Attainable:&lt;/strong&gt; This will be achieved within a single week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Relevant:&lt;/strong&gt; At the end of this process I will have gathered knowledge of existing work and of current thinking and research in the field. I will have begun to develop some ideas of my own which can be possibly be drawn upon at a later date.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Time-Based:&lt;/strong&gt; I will achieve this over two sessions on consecutive days - the first for research, the second for sketching ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have briefly summarised the content of the week’s source material and included some of my own thoughts on the subjects raised. I have then outlined how I understand creativity to naturally exist as part of an exploritative approach, filling the space made available by pushing boundaries beyond current knowledge, normalities and established patterns. I’ve indicated how I view Virtual and Augmented Reality as potentially having a place within an area of interest to me, i.e. apps relating to issue surrounding autism, and touched on issues that may exist for related development. Following this, I have set myself a goal to undertake further research into this area and to begin sketching some possible ideas that I may wish to take forward at a future date.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week Eight - What is Creativity?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/04/18/week-eight-what-is-creativity.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week Eight - What is Creativity?" /><published>2019-04-18T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-04-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/04/18/week-eight-what-is-creativity</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/04/18/week-eight-what-is-creativity.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\creativity-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Creativity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s subject is Creativity. The idea of bringing a truly creative approach to app development is, to me, an exciting one. In fact, the use of the word ‘creative’ in the title of this MA was, for me, probably the biggest draw, particularly seeing it used in conjunction with the words ‘app’ and ‘development’. At the time, when viewed in context of the plethora of computing courses positioned within the realm of the sciences, the bringing together of these words seemed unusual. But to me it seemed a perfectly natural fit. Perhaps the word ‘app’ conjures up something of the current zeitgeist, as the past decade has seen apps become a staple of a modern life, often in playful and entertaining ways. But, even aside from this kind of creative intent, I have long viewed coding &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; as an inherently creative process, and my growth as a programmer has occurred alongside my development as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disruption&quot;&gt;Disruption&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thrust of this week’s lecture, by Prof. Tanya Krzywinska, introduces the analysis of &lt;em&gt;productive creativity&lt;/em&gt; as an academic discipline, examining how building a creative approach directly into the development process, at a fundamental level, and making apps that are exciting for their users, is itself highly effective in generating commercial leverage and monetising the product. In a crowded marketplace, creativity can make an app distinctive and set it apart from the mainstream.  Discussing the nature of creativity itself, Prof. Krzywinska highlights it as a source of ‘disruption’, of de-familiarisation, forcing us to see things differently. It makes things exciting and, consequently, it is a highly marketable commodity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the progression of my own ideas for app development, I intend to hold on to the thoughts and ideas generated by this lecture and to ensure I bring an approach to my own work that embraces them. The idea of risk and creativity going hand-in-hand, is one that I am very familiar with, as a music-creator (‘composer’ seems a little proscriptive of a particular type of music-creator) and artist. I started the course stating that I was interested in innovation and creativity within app development, and this way of thinking about and approaching the process of building apps chimes with my view of app development as being not dissimilar to any other kind of creative or artistic production.  Indeed, the term ‘creative industries’ is now fully accepted, and there appears to be an increasingly close relationship between commercial creative production, and the output produced within the creative app markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hooks-and-stickiness&quot;&gt;Hooks and stickiness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\stickiness-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stickiness&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Prof. Tanya Krzywinska notes, many of the ‘hooks tactics’ that provide ‘stickiness’ to an app have been influenced by the strategies used by soap operas and long-running narratives like Game Of Thrones.  These hooks are used to engage viewers and hold their interest in order to continually bring them back to the show. In games, stickiness has mostly been generated through allowing the player to become more powerful or skilful, but the kind of episodic approach of the soap opera is increasingly being seen in games. This allows cost and risk to be evened out, for instance, by sales of &lt;em&gt;Episode 1&lt;/em&gt; paying for &lt;em&gt;Episode 2&lt;/em&gt;, and so on. In so doing, a brand or franchise becomes more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-benefits-to-education&quot;&gt;The benefits to education&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am interested to note that, as suggested by Prof. Krzywinska, games are not purely about entertainment, but can also be powerful tools for learning; that the feedback that games can provide and the stickiness that keep players engaged can also be used to help learn new skills and to motivate users to do so. This has a particular resonance in terms of my own ideas for game-focused education apps, and I am encouraged to home in on these aspects and utilise them for the purpose of concentrating the learning process, whilst simultaneously inhancing the fun aspects of the learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-stickiness-for-the-app-jam-word-game&quot;&gt;Creating stickiness for the App Jam word game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My word game currently does just one thing. There is no means for progression or to develop the player’s powers. There is just one moment of jeopardy, where the game simply ends with either a ‘you win’ or ‘you lose’. I would like to build some ‘stickiness’ into the game in order for my players to want to continue to play and to come back to the game at a later date. I have created a SMART goal to test out ideas for hooks and to add stickiness: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Specific:&lt;/strong&gt; I would like to encourage the players of my App Jam word game to want to continue to play and to come back to it later, so my goal is to design hooks that will add stickiness to the game.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Measurable:&lt;/strong&gt; I would like to identify two hooks – one being of a ‘power-up’ type and the other a ‘game progression / episode’ type.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Attainable:&lt;/strong&gt; This will be achieved over a single week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Relevant:&lt;/strong&gt; I will apply my hook features to my word game app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Time-Based:&lt;/strong&gt; I will use three sessions for this work – the first session will be to identify and conceptualise the hooks, the second session to prototype the first hook as a feature within the app and the third session to prototype the second hook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been excited by this week’s content. Closing the gap between &lt;em&gt;creativity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;app development&lt;/em&gt; is one of the main reasons I am on the course. I am keen to start trying to develop a way of working that incorporates, at a fundamental level, a creative approach into the developmental process; one that instils a sense of risk-taking and discomfort, which I hope will add excitement to the end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Audience Research lecture and activities from &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/04/15/week-seven-audience-research.html&quot;&gt;week seven&lt;/a&gt; I am also looking forward to thinking about and developing hook structures that add interest and stickiness for my audience, that will encourage them to continue to participate, entice them to return and develop a loyalty to my brand.  In particular, in the case of my education game ideas, I hope that such techniques will aid the process of learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week Seven - Audience Research</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/04/15/week-seven-audience-research.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week Seven - Audience Research" /><published>2019-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/04/15/week-seven-audience-research</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/04/15/week-seven-audience-research.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\audience-research.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Audience Research&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s subject is one that is frustratingly important; ‘frustratingly’, because this is a subject that describes an activity that is close to being absolutely essential whilst, at the same time, a prospect that I do not find to be particularly stimulating. Of course, I recognise the importance of attempting to understand the people that I would like to use my apps and, in so doing, help finance the future of my business. But, to be brutally honest, it is an activity that I would hope could be done by someone for whom marketing is a passion and a talent. I realise that, in all likelihood, I will need to involve myself in audience research at some level if I am to be successful as a creative app developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I do recognise that Audience Research could potentially be a rewarding experience; getting to know my audience could perhaps lead to a sense of fulfilment and, at best, instil a sense of commonality and shared experience. Of course, the ultimate reward would probably be in witnessing the success of my creation, the people using it having been identified, understood, nurtured and encouraged to invest in my work because it is something they desire, enjoy or simply need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recognise the importance of audience research, both in terms of employing marketing and sales methods that suit the particular characteristics that make up the intended audience, but also the potential to tailor the app itself, or aspects of the app, to suit its potential audience. Discovering too late that the targeted audience is actually incompatible with what had been expected in the earlier stages of development or after the marketing budget has been spent, could be disastrous for the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One aspect of Audience Research that I could potentially find to be stimulating is something I have experience in, i.e. the analysis of the data - transcribing the results, getting a feel for the data and what it ‘means’, and then reporting on the findings. However, this, along with the design of the research project and the physical act of gathering the data itself, looks to be an extremely labour-intensive activity and something that, from my perspective, as someone who is excited by creative and technical development, but for whom the concept of Audience Research is of less interest, I imagine to be less daunting and onerous if it were shared amongst a team, no matter how small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods-of-audience-research&quot;&gt;Methods of Audience Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this week’s video, &lt;strong&gt;Erik Geelhoed&lt;/strong&gt;, who has a background in &lt;em&gt;Psychology and Experimental Statistics&lt;/em&gt; and has built up an impressive and diverse experience in academia and within the industry, outlines the main methodologies involved in Audience Research, starting with a discussion of why it is a necessary activity. All this seems admirably logical and simple in its reasoning: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your audience is your key to success&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the larger the audience you can engage, the greater the chance of success&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in order to be successful, one’s product must be exciting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what is exciting is different to different people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;therefore, in order to engage and excite your audience, it is necessary to understand the diversity and the characteristics of your audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we are working within an international market place, and cannot meet our audience in person, investigating one’s audience is a challenge, but there are a number of tools and techniques available to us for this purpose. Two important, complimentary approaches are: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\qualitative-quantitative.png&quot; alt=&quot;Qualitative and Quantitative methods&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-qualitative-methods&quot;&gt;1. Qualitative methods&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\keep-calm-and-ask-the-audience.png&quot; alt=&quot;Qualitative Audience Research&quot; width=&quot;240px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cognitive walkthrough / thinking aloud - asking the user to use the app and think aloud&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interview - asking the right questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Group interview - researcher-led&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participants keeping a diary&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Observations - the ‘whats’ and ‘whys’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self-reflections of the researcher (i.e. yourself)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-quantitative-methods&quot;&gt;2. Quantitative methods&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\quantitative-research-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quantitative Audience Research&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Obtaining numbers, statistics, for analysis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Questionnaires&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physiological measurements - e.g. levels of attention (EEG: electroencephalogram - a test used to evaluate the electrical activity in the brain), sweat secretion (GSR: galvanic skin response - a change in the electrical resistance of the skin that is a physiochemical response to emotional arousal which increases sympathetic nervous system activity)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technology logs – when started, stopped, which buttons pressed, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Observations – when and how long, how often&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Psycho-physical testing – hearing, seeing, tasting, feeling, smelling etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;advice-on-qualitative-analysis&quot;&gt;Advice on qualitative analysis&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is qualitative analysis that most likely will be used used - this is not necessarily so different from quantitative methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During the &lt;strong&gt;interviewing&lt;/strong&gt; process (often called in-depth interview), be yourself. The interview is only as good as your questions, so know what you want to find out. Chose subjects who are representative of your target population. Maybe ask friends or family if they are in some small way representative. Make sure both parties sign a consent form.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt; is time demanding and time consuming. Do the transcription of the data collected yourself, getting a good feel for the data. Mark the interviews with comments, classify them, categorise them, then write a report. Transcribing should preferably be verbatim (incl. ‘eh’, ‘aaahh’ etc). Maybe use an audio editor and repeatedly loop short sections. The questions themselves &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; the categories for analysis, but you can add more. Write up the analysis and use quotes as illustration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-a-persona-for-the-app-jam-word-game&quot;&gt;Creating a ‘persona’ for the App Jam word game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\persona.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Persona&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My App Jam project - an arcade-style word game - is something that I view as having educational value in the sense that it could potentially be helpful in sharpening the ability to understand the meaning of words and their meaningful relationships with other words.
In order to better understand my potential audience for this app, it would be an interesting exercise to create a ‘persona’, i.e. &lt;em&gt;a fictional character that represents a user of the application&lt;/em&gt;, that would represent my target audience. I have created a SMART goal to support this: -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Specific:&lt;/strong&gt; In order to better understand my potential audience for my App Jam word game app, my goal is to create a fictional persona, who will represent a typical user.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Measurable:&lt;/strong&gt; I will create one persona and post the results on the Personas forum on Canvas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Attainable:&lt;/strong&gt; I will learn about creating personas by following the Pluralsight course &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/creating-effective-user-stories/table-of-contents&quot;&gt;Creating Effective User Stories&lt;/a&gt;, with particular attention to the &lt;em&gt;Personas&lt;/em&gt; section.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Relevant:&lt;/strong&gt; The research and the resulting persona will help my understand a potential typical user of my app and, therefore, some of the characteristics of the audience I intend to target.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Time-Based:&lt;/strong&gt; I will create this persona in a single session of approximately two hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have discussed how important Audience Research is to the success of an app, in terms of understanding the characteristics of its potential audience in order to inform marketing strategies, tailoring the app and avoiding costly mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have recognised that my lack of enthusiasm for the process, partly due to my interests being in other aspects of the creative process and because of the time and resources that need to be applied to the activity, can be partially offset not only by its importance to the app’s success, but the prospect of there being potentially rewarding aspects in terms of personal satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have summarised the main points from Erik Geelhoed’s lecture on Audience Research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have then created a SMART goal in order to form an image of the kind of potential audience ‘persona’ that may exist for my App Jam word game.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week Six - Creative App Commerce</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/03/30/week-six-creative-app-commerce.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week Six - Creative App Commerce" /><published>2019-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/03/30/week-six-creative-app-commerce</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/03/30/week-six-creative-app-commerce.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\commerce-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;App Commerce&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s subject matter focuses on commerce and, within this broad subject, the importance of funding, monetization models, pitching your product, and understanding the importance and nuances of a good business plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my own perspective, although I have little experience of these issues personally and it is admittedly a little daunting, it is also tinged with excitement due to the possibilities of getting it right. Many years ago I was involved in assessing small-scale funding applications whilst working for the &lt;em&gt;Arts Council of England&lt;/em&gt;, so I do have something of an idea of the importance of a good pitch and an understanding of what it is that will make those with money likely to be open to investing in a product. I have also worked in a self-employed capacity and, as such, I also know the importance of a good business plan. However, at the time I did not fully engage myself in this process and, at least partly as a result, I found myself unable to continue in this vein and instead ended up working as an employee for a company. Notwithstanding the huge amount I learned in technical terms during my time with this organisation, I have always regretted not giving the process of running my own business a better shot. This makes the subject this week particularly poignant and of great interest to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-great-product&quot;&gt;A great product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\great-product-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A great product&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his video, Rich Barham of Round Table Games firstly emphasizes the importance of a great product to start with. In the competitive world of creative app development - in his case, specifically games - the need for an extremely polished, well-tested product is paramount. This is the first aspect that your monetization model should be built on - clearly you need your audience, users or players to keep coming back to your product and to recommend it to their friends. The team working on the product must be all on the same page and share a collective understanding, vision and feel for exactly what is being created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monetisation&quot;&gt;Monetisation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\monetisation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Monetisation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really considered here, although it is mentioned, is &lt;em&gt;monetisation&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. the ways in which an app itself can generate money. There are many articles on the subject to be found on the internet. One, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.co/news/6-app-monetization-models-make-money-2015-08&quot;&gt;tech.co&lt;/a&gt;, lists six possible models: In-app advertising, in-app purchasing, freemium (some features locked in free version), paywalls (subscriptions), paid apps, sponsorship. Other articles include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adperio.com/blog/top-5-app-monetization-trends-in-2019/&quot;&gt;adperio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessofapps.com/marketplace/app-marketing/research/app-monetization-models/&quot;&gt;BusinessOfApps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/app-monetization/&quot;&gt;mobiloud&lt;/a&gt;. This list goes on..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;business-plan&quot;&gt;Business plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\business-plan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Business plan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good business plan is needed for getting investors on board.  Depending on the type of product you are selling and the type of investors you hope to attract, there is a need to create a tailored business plan. Lists of categories that need to be covered can be obtained from the various business plan templates available - &lt;a href=&quot;https://canvanizer.com/new/business-model-canvas&quot;&gt;Canvas&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Templates differ depending on the type of audience you are aiming for, as will advice from the various business advisor companies. If the given plan is not suitable for your own audience, then it should be changed accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important to know what you’re looking for in terms of investment, what it needs to cover, the specifics of your own particular situation. As an example, Rich Barham suggested that, if you want to bring in a great developer into your team it may be considered a selling point, but won’t be cheap. The importance is that the plan is built for what will work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;funding&quot;&gt;Funding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\funding.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Funding&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding is very personal, in terms of how much money is required, the way funding will be provided and for what purpose - personnel, software, hardware, the size of the organisation, the type of project and how long it will take etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of different types of funding: -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grant funding - government or Arts Council grants, charitable organisations etc. Sometimes &lt;strong&gt;match funding&lt;/strong&gt; is required, in which case the fundee needs to put their own funding in to get funding out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Venture Capitalists - companies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Angel investors - individuals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loans - can be dangerous because of personal liability. Small companies sometimes may take a small loan along with other forms of funding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweat equity&lt;/strong&gt;: if you have no money of your own to put in, it may be possible to put a value on actual work, depending on your value as a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pitching&quot;&gt;Pitching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\pitching.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pitching&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something that is difficult for many people and is something that takes is lots of practice. Public speaking, essentially what this is, is something that is learned. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toastmasters.org/&quot;&gt;Toastmasters International&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a resource to aid this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different ways of pitching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elevator pitch - about two minutes maximum. In this time you need to interest your audience by showing them the potential to make large sums of money. You do not have the opportunity to use slides or materials. It is important to judge these well, as you could potentially annoy or even alienate a potential investor by catching them at the wrong moment or with the wrong type of message.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time or competition pitch - three minutes and a single slide. These are run as a kind of competition, usually with a prize. The pressure is high and they can be terrifying, but are great practice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creative pitch - selling the creative side of your idea to a creative audience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business pitch - showing figures and not much else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a pitch can be a combination of both creative and business pitches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a pitch needs to be right for the audience.  It needs to be tailored to the particular investor. The most important thing is that you do your research in order to get this absolutely right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unique-selling-point-usp&quot;&gt;Unique Selling Point (USP)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\usp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Unique Selling Point&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These really do need to be unique - often they are not - and this is a big challenge. If you believe you have a USP make absolutely certain that is really is truly unique - it can be an embarrassing disaster to be ‘called out’ on this. Again, research is vital. It is important you can explain why it is unique and, if it has not been done before, what is the reason for this? Make sure the unique aspect is actually desirable.  If it is not unique, do not pitch it as unique, but state why it is better than the other available options.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-to-write-a-business-plan&quot;&gt;Learning to write a business plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will create a SMART goal to complete a course on writing a Business Plan so that I feel confident I have the knowledge required in order to approach the task when required to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it specific:&lt;/strong&gt; I need to build my knowledge and confidence in my ability to write a strong business plan. So my goal is to complete the Udemy course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/how-to-write-a-winning-business-plan-in-2-hours/learn/v4/overview&quot;&gt;How to Write a Winning Business Plan in 2 Hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Measureable:&lt;/strong&gt; The course will provide me with the foundation and knowledge to create a business plan which will help my chances of starting a successful business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Attainable:&lt;/strong&gt; I have already purchased the course on the Udemy website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Relevant:&lt;/strong&gt; I will need to create robust business plans for the business I intend to start after completing the MA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Time-based:&lt;/strong&gt; I will complete the course in a single session and write a practice plan in another session.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a much to consider when it comes to commerce, starting with a great product, a suitable business plan, exploring opportunities for funding and the ability to pitch ideas to potential investors. All of this requires a great deal of diligence, research, effort and confidence in what you are doing and how you are doing it. I see this as making sure a huge amount of attention is paid to the detail, ensuring that all avenues are being explored and nothing is going amiss. It was mainly down to a lack of this, along with my own naivety and ignorance, that in the past I missed an opportunity. I have created a SMART goal to complete an online business plan writing course and to practice writing a plan in order to consolidate my new knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week Six - Graphics and Animation Research</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/03/28/week-six-graphics-animation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week Six - Graphics and Animation Research" /><published>2019-03-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/03/28/week-six-graphics-animation</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/03/28/week-six-graphics-animation.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;outcomes-from-week-four-smart-goal&quot;&gt;Outcomes from week four SMART goal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sprint&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;sprint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As an aspiring developer of game and game-like web-based apps , I would like to have the tools and know-how in order to create and animate interesting 2D graphics within a web browser.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Research graphics and animation software, languages, libraries and techniques - predominently 2D but taking in 3D if interesting and/or relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, as I have no firm idea of where to start, I will take a somewhat &lt;em&gt;scattershot&lt;/em&gt; approach. Below I will firstly show a brief indication - not much more than a list - of what I found during my initial research. Following this, I will delve a little further into a selection of the results from which, given I am now coming from a more informed position, I will have begun forming an idea of any potential for my purpose.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;animation&quot;&gt;Animation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whist researching browser-based animation solutions, I innevitably came across some that are more specificially oriented towards games or that are probably more suitable for attractive and interactive website design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://animejs.com/&quot;&gt;anime.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\animejs.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Anime JS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open source&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lightweight
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://threejs.org/&quot;&gt;three.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\threejs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three JS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3D rendering engine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Been around a while - well established but maybe being superceded.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://velocityjs.org/&quot;&gt;velocity.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\velocityjs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Velocity JS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not the best for games&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Used in WhatsApp
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://popmotion.io/&quot;&gt;popmotion.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\popmotion.png&quot; alt=&quot;Popmotion&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Game engine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very popular&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good with typescript&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looks good for 2D games especially&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did come across some complaints about its architecture and how well-written it is
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\images\greensock.png&quot; alt=&quot;Greensock GSAP&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Been around a long time and is very well supported&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;large community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Works well with pure JavaScript, of course, and with Vue, React and Angular.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Angular angle (!) I need to investigate further.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But.. it is perhaps a bit corporate? Logos, business website animations?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some of the libraries, such as Draggable, could be very useful for more simple games&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autism games / apps come to mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For more complex animations and interactions, you’ll want javascript. There are two libraries I would start with (and a thousands more out there). I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://greensock.com/&quot;&gt;greensock&lt;/a&gt; for manipulating DOM elements, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mojs.io/&quot;&gt;mo.js&lt;/a&gt; for making animations from scratch in javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Truly it has been a wonderful sight to watch the online gaming industry go from using Flash and Java to power their games, to using powerful 2D and 3D gaming engines that mostly are run through JavaScript and HTML5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;JavaScript has already proved its capacity when it comes to developing top-quality games. And as you might expect from a language that counts with so many frameworks and libraries, there are tons of game engine options that can fit your programming skills and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-research&quot;&gt;Further research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To greater or lesser extents, I would like to take a slightly deeper look at: -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CSS transformations / animations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Canvas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pixi.js (rendering engine)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;p5.js (graphics/drawing)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;phaser.js (game framework)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Babylon / PlayCanvas (3D rendering)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A potential complication&lt;/strong&gt; - and I am currently not sure how big a complication it may be - is that I have been working in &lt;strong&gt;Angular&lt;/strong&gt; and would not like to deviate from this framework. As these are JavaScript libraries they should be able to integrate, but the tutorials will no doubt make use of &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; JavaScript. There will undoubtedly be some fildding about and further research to bring them into an Angular environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staple of the world wide web, the DOM, and all web design. 
I need to get to know at least its capabilities before getting to know what the various JavaScript libraries and rendering engines can provide that is different, i.e. that cannot be done with CSS, or could be done in an easier, quicker or more efficient way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will attempt to pick up the basics of what I think I will need from CSS, and fill in any gaps as I learn the libraries, frameworks and engines. I may find that I do not need everying, so I will not set out to attempt to understand everything. Ultimately, it about getting enough information to start using it in my apps (currently I’m working on my AppJam project, The Odd Word Out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can CSS do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ability to create client-interactive effects.&lt;br /&gt;
Can produce some complex effects. Best used directly for interesting visual and interactive&lt;br /&gt;
web pages. Games etc?.. probably less so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The transition always happens &lt;em&gt;moving towards&lt;/em&gt; the state set in CSS. So different transitions can be set in initial and end states, so transition is different in one direction to when returning to original state.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pixijs&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PixiJS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Pixi?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;March 23rd 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi#introduction&quot;&gt;From PixiJS tutorial&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pixi is an extremely fast 2D sprite rendering engine. What does that mean? It means that it helps you to display, animate and manage interactive graphics so that it’s easy for you to make games and applications using JavaScript and other HTML5 technologies. It has a sensible, uncluttered API and includes many useful features, like supporting texture atlases and providing a streamlined system for animating sprites (interactive images). It also gives you a complete scene graph so that you can create hierarchies of nested sprites (sprites inside sprites), as well as letting you attach mouse and touch events directly to sprites. And, most importantly, Pixi gets out of your way so that you can use as much or as little of it as you want to, adapt it to your personal coding style, and integrate it seamlessly with other useful frameworks…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The strength of Pixi’s API is that it’s general-purpose: it’s not a game engine. That’s good because it gives you total expressive freedom to make anything you like, and wrap your own custom game engine around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tutorial suggests learning Unix. A webserver needs to be run in the root project directory and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server&quot;&gt;http-server&lt;/a&gt; is suggested for this purpose. Of course, I’d love to follow this option, as I’d love to follow all options ever given to me, in order to become the most knowledgable and versatile developer ever to have lived. However, I would like to pick up as much as I can in as short a time as I can. As I said earlier, I will fill in holes that need to be filled, later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am going to use &lt;em&gt;Brackets&lt;/em&gt; for now. Mongoose webserver may be the next optpion to take, but just to learn and to try some coding, &lt;em&gt;Brackets&lt;/em&gt; will do. Actually, as I’m going to be working in Angular, I don’t think I will need a separate webserver as importing the libraries into the Angular project and then hosting the dev project with &lt;em&gt;$ ng serve&lt;/em&gt; should do the trick. But it’s &lt;em&gt;Brackets&lt;/em&gt; for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;March 24th 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t a problem at all. I installed http-server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-cmd&quot; data-lang=&quot;cmd&quot;&gt;npm install http-server -g&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and used VSCode. Simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incentally, Brackets is a very useful tool as it it does not require a server and is very immediate. VSCode is still my IDE of choice, but Brackets has found a place in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kick start my foray into PixiJS I followed a short four-part series of videos on YouTube &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuY_PROTr0I&quot;&gt;CJGammon Pixi course&lt;/a&gt; being the first. It was very useful in terms of getting started with no prior knowledge.  I’ve since started looking at the official documentation with a much better idea of what is involved. Sometimes, the visual ‘taught’, ‘hold-my-hand’ method is the best way to get into a new subject.  Once given a foot-hold, further subjects are much more easily tackled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do want to start using this in my Angular project as soon as possible. All the courses and documentation use pure JavaScrip.  However, I am going to see how easy it is to follow and learn the subject whilst simultaneously ‘translating’ into TypeScipt and, with possibly more difficulty, the Angular framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means ensuring my Odd Word Out project is safe in source control and I’m happy to hack away in order to replace the current methods with Pixi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages of Pixi (and this could be said of other options): -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uses WebGL as standard and if not available will use Canvas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hardware acceleration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built-in methods and classes that make working with graphical animation accessible without having to build everything from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integration with Game Engines, such as Phaser, GDevelop etc.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;March 27th 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ive-been-using-pixijs---what-are-my-thoughts&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve been using PixiJS - what are my thoughts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of what I think I need for my app / game development, PixiJS does not really feel &lt;em&gt;‘right’&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;* but see notes below&lt;/span&gt;). I don’t feel comfortable with it as a way of achieving what I have already managed to do with ‘pure’ JavaScript (via TypeScript, if you can call this methodology ‘pure JavaScript’). In particular, I have not found any accessible way into creating individual graphic objects that have their own unique properties, such as the word they carry, their direction of movement and their speed. I’m sure that this must be possible, but I want to find out how to do this quickly, and the available documentation does not make this information easily available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am considering looking at p5.js because, from what I’ve seen in the many youtube videos available, it may be a better fit to my current knowledge and pattern of coding more comfortably.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;March 28th 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s amazing how much can change in a day!&lt;/strong&gt; Through perseverance and persistence I’ve found out how to 
add objects and any number of properties to a Sprite (or any kind of graphic) object. It now seems obvious - as this is a JavaScript library it makes sense that, as with JavaScript, properties can be created and attached to an object by just refering to them! In TypeScript: -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-typescript&quot; data-lang=&quot;typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;player&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Sprite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Sprite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;player&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;player&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'my text'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//adds properties id and text to player object and gives them values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So easy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve managed to transfer the methods employed in my existing code onto to the new requirements of PixiJS and a new way of working. The movement is smooth and controllable, e.g. velocity, and collisions are easy to detect. There’s plenty still for me to get my teeth into and to learn, but I’ve satisfied myself that I have chosen a useful new way of exploring browser-based graphics and animation.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The video below shows my appjam project after converting to use PixiJS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things worth mentioning: -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I had to turn off hardware acceleration in Chrome in order to capture the video (the software I use - &lt;em&gt;Open Broadcast Software (OBS)&lt;/em&gt; - will not work with it switched on). As Pixi makes use of hardware acceleration, the result is slower,less smooth and tends to stutter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I grabbed any image I could find to use for the sprite - this would clearly be something different - possibly a balloon - as I continue to develop the game and will likely use sprite sheets for individual sprite animations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I changed the gameplay so that characters wrap around the screen rather than bounce of the edges. I’m not sure which I prefer, but it could be possible to use both options for different levels as the game progresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;video style=&quot;width:1120px;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;\media\odd-word-out-pixi.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
    Woops! Your browser does not support the HTML5 video tag.
  &lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned a lot from this sprint: -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSS transformations&lt;/strong&gt;: I knew little to speak of about this subject, but now I have enough of a knowledge to be feel confident I can, or at least know it is possible and, therefore, I can find out how to, make some interesting effects in order to add greater levels of interaction and interest to my apps and websites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;PixiJS&lt;/strong&gt;, I have engaged with a popular JavaScript animation library / rendering engine, with good support and a good community, and have a pretty firm grounding from which to further explore and integrate animations in my future work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have researched other JavaScript animation libraries and know there are options other than PixiJS that will have their own advantages for specific uses, and &lt;strong&gt;I am looking forward to further exploration of these&lt;/strong&gt; in due course.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have become more aware of the existence of &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript Game Engines&lt;/strong&gt; and know I can call on these if needs arise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have become aware of the exciting possiblities of the &lt;strong&gt;3D graphics libraries and frameworks&lt;/strong&gt; which, in particular, are at the forefront of developing the possibilities of &lt;strong&gt;WebVR&lt;/strong&gt; in the web browser.
    &lt;h1 id=&quot;these-i-must-explore-in-due-course&quot;&gt;These I &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; explore in due course!!&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
