&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.. at least, for now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like the simplicity of the approach. Oculus SDK is somewhat ‘noodly’, requiring many different configurations and components depending on the specific scenario and associated setup. Unity XR appears to be more streamlined in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XR will be much more future-proof, with Unity intending on deprecating support for Oculus SDK at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As XR developes over time, my knowledge and understanding will grow with it. I will not need to start at the bottom of a steep learning curve when the target point is fast disappearing over the horizon. I will, hopefully, be within sight of that point throughout the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hand tracking will be incoporated at some point. At the moment I don’t believe I will require it, but I know I will in the future. If I find I need it sooner rather than later, then I can always revert to the Oculus SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XR is the future. Unity is developing a multi-platform solution for both VR and AR development that exposes functionality in low-level C# APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began looking at the possibility of creating my ‘boilerplate’ start-up project using Unity XR and ditching the ‘old’ Oculus Integration SDK. However, a concern is that, while there are many good reasons to do this, XR &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; not be fully developed enough on which to base my immediate project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oculus SDK is tried and tested and I am comfortable enough using it. While the multi-platform nature of Unity XR will be very useful in time, setting up and incorporating it could set me on a steep new learning curve that I perhaps don’t have time for right now. ‘Upgrading’ to XR at some stage could always be an option, even if it could prove tricky and time-consuming. It could always be done at an apporpriate time in the product’s development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oculus Quest &lt;strong&gt;hand tracking&lt;/strong&gt; is something I know I would like to explore, and it’s currently being developed by Oculus, with updates appearing fairly regularly. Currently this is not an option with XR integration. I imagine it will appear at some point, but I currently cannot find any confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a shame, because I always like to keep up to speed with the latest developments - it’s easy to fall behind in this fast-moving business - but in practically terms, this could be one occasion that the best option would be to stick with the tried-and-tested pair of old comfortable shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XR Integration in Unity&lt;/strong&gt;

The player needs to be prepared and ready for action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;starting-the-game&quot;&gt;Starting the game&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up spending much time on this and getting it right is not a simple thing.  I imagine it to be something that is helped hugely by experience in game design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The environment now resembles a theatre in some respects. There is a ‘stage’, where the action happens, a curtain of sorts that keeps all the initial preparation for the ‘performance’ from the audience’s view, and a futher curtain that I refer to as the ‘fire curtain’, again after the theatre. This final curtain came about as a means to hide what is in effect the means to get the game going. Initially I began the game with a spoken narrative welcoming the player and explaining the situation, before presenting them with a button to press to open the main curatin and start working on disaster deployment. However, I discovered that this was actually placing the player too far into the introduction, and really, it is they that needs to set the game in motion - hence the final ‘fire’ curtain, which only opens when the ‘play’ button has been pressed. It is at this point that the introductions begin, resulting in the user being offered the keyboard in order to enter their name (which will ulitmately be used to update the leaderboard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these curtain were a bit boring to watch, so I updated the fire curtain to an animation of the word &lt;em&gt;ShelterBox&lt;/em&gt; - perfectly satisfactory for the pupose of providing enough interest whilst explaining the game without providing too much of a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entering the player’s name allows the welcome to be personalised with a message on the backdrop. I may update this to become some form of &lt;strong&gt;placard or a gilded sign&lt;/strong&gt;, extending the personal touch and further engaging the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All taken into concideration, this reasonably satisfactory, and should suffice for the purpose of this game in the shorter term, but I expect to make improvements at some point once the all-important gameplay is working well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">How to start and end the game?

&lt;p&gt;Then build complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I am thinking of earning a standard small number of points for each item assigned to a cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gain a larger number of points for completing a deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gain points with respective funds raised&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lose some points for dropping an item on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lose points for assigning to an incorrect scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lose points for assigning when you have already assigned the item to that scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lose points for going into the red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reset score to zero?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lose arbitrary number of points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gain arbitrary number of points.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Welcome. Thank you for volunteering. We have a critical situation. There are a number of disasters that require your urgent attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your willingness to help is much appreciated. We are currently experiencing extremely high levels of disruption to everyday lives on a global scale. Current pressure ratings are at dangerous levels. We are relying on your calm efficiency, pragmatism and intelligence to help bring us back to within calm and sustainable levels. Are you willing to engage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These resources are precious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Please assign them carefully to the disasters with which you are confronted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t forget: be cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Be careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Diligent planning will help more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Too much attention to a single cause can mean failure for so many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text to speech service I have been using provides a satisfying balance between realistic and synthesised, where the voice is noticably unreal but also pleasant, calming and soothing in a very human way. Although very different in tone, it encompasses some of the character I wanted to emulate that is present in the wonderfully recongnisable and now ubiquitous standard for artificial intelligence that is the voice of &lt;strong&gt;HAL 9000&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My failed attempts to find a suitably similar speech synthesiser did not actually last very long. I did not want to use the exact same voice - it would be a little too derivative my taste and too denotive of something that I am not trying to re-create. But it was the character that I wanted to harness. I want to keep the player aware of their relationship with the game, to continue to let them know they are part of something that is not an actual and genuine attempt at a pretence to pass itself off as real, and this may be emphasised by the slightly separate and other-worldly nature of the immersive environment.

&lt;p&gt;This has proved to be not a simple as I’d expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard input methods using Unity are not so easy to customise. That’s not to say it can’t be done, but unless you are a very experienced and knowledgable Unity / VR developer, it does not appear as anything close to a straightforward process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible I have missed something that ought to be obvious, but missed it I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found some assets on the Unity App Store - the free options I could not get working. Again, it could be possible to work with these and perhaps I am being a little hasty in my dismissal of them, but I do not have a lot of time and, unless there is accompanying documentation or something comes up from a few Google searches or checking out YouTube tutorials, then my patience is stretched beyond breaking point. It’s then time to move on to something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One that looked interesting was VR Keyboard, which uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_kUlVTyRag&quot;&gt;xylaphone-style mallets to hit the keys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_kUlVTyRag&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/Q_kUlVTyRag/0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VR Keys&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I could not get this to work in my Oculus Quest setup. But then I found VRKB which is very similar, is newer (July 2019), has no reviews, no feedback anywhere. But it costs $10 - not a huge amount of money, but what if it does not work - it’s money down the drain. But it does have &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.unity.com/threads/released-vrkb-virtual-reality-keyboard.735905/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; an accompanying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=90&amp;amp;v=J1dHujWH23s&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&quot;&gt;video on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; in which the develop demonstrates how easy it is to set up. The video has no likes, no dislikes and no comments, which is a concern, but it exists and that counts for something!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found two other potential suiters in the asset store - $4.99 and $15 respectively. Like VRKB they do not specifically mention Oculus Quest, but I am tempted by them, in the order of cheapest first. They are more standard in their operation - the $4.99 one looks like it uses gazing predominantly, but has possibly been recently updated to use lazer pointing. But I do like the idea of those xylophone mallets… hmmm…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;an-aside-this-is-very-interesting&quot;&gt;An aside: this is very interesting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not something for this project - far from it - but very interesting none the less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFGweUpAs8I&quot;&gt;VR-OS: Keyboard and Mouse - Custom hardware and software implementation&lt;/a&gt;. I’m mentioning it purely for its fascination value - I would love to be in a position to play around with this kind of thing. It uses a physical setup, tracking hand movements as they interacting with a physical keyboard and trackable mouse, using this data in realtime in a VR environment. So there is no need to use a virtual keyboard/mouse or to remove the headset in order to use the physical objects. It’s fun and practical. However, as Augmented Reality grows in use and potential, this kind of thing should become an interesting footnote in the onward march of virtual technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went for VR UIKit. $35 including tax. More than just the keyboard - also includes other useful-looking UI snippets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not as easy to set up as I’d hoped. But still a good learning curve continuation that will help in the long-haul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;this-is-strange-isnt-it&quot;&gt;This is strange, isn’t it?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been striving to make my game more like a ‘proper’ game, knowing that this will aid the sense of immersion for the player. However, I wasn’t really ready for how much this really does happen! It doesn’t matter that the actions within the game - animations, sounds, responses to input and stimulii - could potentially be increasingly removed from what is real, in terms of actually real and expected within normal real-world physical situations and resulting from real-world physical interactions. The feeling of immersion increases as I increase the number of animations and game devices, as long as they adhere to a ‘seriousness’ and are not too frivolous in a way that could be viewed as self-indulgent. If the game believes it, then the player is asked to also believe it, and the player is all too happy to oblige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we are so used to games in modern culture that these have been accepted into and as reality. Media such as film, TV, games etc, along with the increasing aborbsion into the mainstream of ways to interact with our world via artiface and interface, have formed a kind of new relationship with reality and, in fact, caused a playful ‘fourth wall’ to come into being - in order to be broken - between ourselves and our reality. Reality is boring. Let’s create an alternative one that distorts or enhances it. This is much more fun! The 20th Century was in many ways, the centure of drugs and alternaive ways of seeing, opening the ‘doors of perception’. It’s perfectly fitting and proper that we should feel comfortable immersing ourselves within a made up world, as long as the world itself can convince us that it is real. Even better if it adds value and it an improvement on what we are currently lumbered with!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">How making the game more like a game makes it more like reality</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What Am I Doing?

&lt;h1 id=&quot;leader-board&quot;&gt;Leader board&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tapping into the competitive nature of (most) human beings, and the reason for the actual existence of (most) games (that’s a statement I will need to back up with some sound research!), it may be worth developing the &lt;em&gt;competitive&lt;/em&gt; side of the game. Introducing a scoring system and a subsequent &lt;em&gt;leader board&lt;/em&gt; could achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’d like to incorporate a multi-player aspect to this game at some point, this could be looked at from a number of perspectives. Competition between individuals playing individually, is one thing, but there could also be competition between individuals playing as a team. It may be that individuals get rewarded for being more successful than their co-player, but is could also be that individuals get rewarded for being more team-oriented. These are concepts I will further explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-to-do-when-a-disaster-scenario-has-been-fully-deployed&quot;&gt;What to do when a disaster scenario has been fully deployed?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace with a new mission:&lt;/strong&gt; I have played with ideas around replacing a completed mission with a new one. This involved selecting a report from the list - i.e. the list that a random selection is taken from at the start of the game - and replacing the completed report.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close down the screen:&lt;/strong&gt; with style! Screen spins round, shrinks and vanishes! Will need suitable sound effects for this. I imagine this being tied up with the points scoring system, whereby a completed mission is worth a large amount of points, to be added to the points scored by assigning resource objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;wind-zone&quot;&gt;Wind zone&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increasingly gusty wind zone to blow resources off course. I could use Unity’s ‘wind-zone’ object or, as I did in the &lt;em&gt;disaster scenario&lt;/em&gt; scene of my prototype, define a large collider that applies directional forces to objects that enter within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;haptic-feedback&quot;&gt;Haptic feedback&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I want to include some tactile feedback for the user when picking up objects and touching buttons and screens etc., as usual I searched the internet for documentation, advice and tutorials. As is often the case, the Oculus documentation is limited and did not examine a real-world scenario. The instruction provided is to use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; static void OVRInput.SetControllerVibration(float frequency, float amplitude, Controller controllerMask)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-haptics/?locale=en_GB&quot;&gt;Oculus documentation: Unity Haptics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;so calling &amp;gt; OVRInput.SetControllerVibration(1, 1, OVRInput.Controller.RTouch); 
should do the trick. Except it is very uncontrollable. I want a short burst and this lasts for 2 seconds. This would mean I would have to contrive a a short burst using a coroutine in order to instigate a short delay before stopping the feedback (i.e. with zero values for frequency and amplitude). 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, as it often the case, further searching found better, more usable, solutions. In particular one from Valem (Valam is a very handy guy to have around, as I’ve mentioned elsewhere) provided a thoughtful and useful solution. His can either use a sound file to control the nuances of the haptic feedback or can take parameters that define the frequency, duration and strength in a much more controllable way when compared to Oculus’s own API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I explore ideas I will, no doubt about it, find that some of my attempts to make this game compelling, simply fail. Others, hopefully, can be rescued and built upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource object time-out:&lt;/strong&gt; I have added a timer to the collectable resource objects, which begins count-down the moment an object is picked up. If the object is still being held when the counter reaches zero then object is destoyed and placed back in its box. The mechanic is in place, but how it is used is not defined just yet. Currently, the length of time available for the player to keep hold of the object before dispatching it to a disaster scenario reduces as the game progresses, but the potential is there for this to be used as an added complexity, perhaps adding an incentive to keep the budget levels high.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources cost money:&lt;/strong&gt; Each resource object has a price tag, and the availble budget is reduces by each resource deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funds can be raised:&lt;/strong&gt; A random fund-raising event is displayed on the computer screen next to the player and the player has the option to initiate one of these when the budget gets low. Currently this just sets the budget back to its initial value, but I will be working on the mechanic to add complexity. For instance, each event has an estimated potential funding return which can be used as a base for a psuedo random actual value. I also imagine the event to take some time before any funds are made available - after all, realistically time must be allowed for planning etc. and an event can only take place some time after it has been given the go-ahead. I am also thinking of giving a short window to select the event before it vanishes. It may be that the player has to wait with no funds before another event becomes available.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we’re all on government-inforced lock-down. Generally, this is already having a significant effect on everyday life, but how will it effect my MA development work and studies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m working from home&lt;/strong&gt;. This in itself is not a huge issue - it’s something I’ve done regularly for many years, albeit not for every day of the week and for such a prolonged period is this is set to be. However, this is not working from home (WFH) under normal cicumstances due to the fact that…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schools are closed&lt;/strong&gt;. My elder, year-7, Key Stage 2 son is home from school and needs a certain amount of ‘assistance’ (or maybe coersion) with getting on with the limited quantity of available online schooling, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My younger son&lt;/strong&gt;, who is home-schooled on an ABA (Applied Behaviour Analysis) programme, &lt;strong&gt;finds himself with no tutor&lt;/strong&gt; - one is self-isolating whilst the other is.. well, staying home. He is unable to be left to his own devices and requires full intensive interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My lovely wife is also working from home&lt;/strong&gt;. Between us, we have quite a load. We will need to use some - hopefully not all- of our annual leave to keep son two’s education going. Unfortunately, how I can find time for my usual once-per-week study day is not certain. Today, it was impossible. It’s now nearly 8pm and I’m just getting going - unfortunately I’m further delayed by writing about these issues!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the NEC Expo go ahead?&lt;/strong&gt; Apparently so, but it has been postponed to 7th-9th May 2021! That’s right.. &lt;strong&gt;2021!&lt;/strong&gt; So it doesn’t really feel like it is postponed but, rather, cancelled for this year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the 2020 Rotary Convention in Honolulu go ahead?&lt;/strong&gt; Nope - it’s been cancelled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I’m thinking I will continue to build the app as though my deadline for a complete working version has not changed. Hopefully there will be further events this year and, in any case, whatever happens, it will be ready ‘off-the-shelf’ should it be required. I feel sure it will be - it’s the ‘when’ that is uncertain right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;to-pivot-or-not-to-pivot-that-is-the-question&quot;&gt;To pivot, or not to pivot. That is the question.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I decide to take this tack, then I will be continuing to use this module as an extension of the last - GAM740 - which was all about working with a client in delivering a ‘product’ in response to a brief. I have been informed, of course, that this is absolutely fine with the university. However, what about all those Unity, Oculus, general VR and game development techniques that I’m still learning? I keep coming across new nuggets of game programming techniques or patterns that are new to me and I am itching to learn and put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the one hand&lt;/strong&gt;, I have been absolutely fine putting these tempting morsels to one side for the time being in order to ensure that a usable product is created in time for the looming deadline. I’ll be able to come back to these, is the thinking. In fact, it’s great that I’m stock-piling empty boxes and, although I know they will eventually need filling, at least I have an idea of the tasks that lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the other hand&lt;/strong&gt;, this could now be a chance to start filling some of these boxes, whilst still aiming for a usable viable product. At the end of such a process, I will have increased my knowledge and ability to tackle problems in the future. However, this is set against the vagueness of the targetted final result in respect of the need to take a finished product off the peg, if required to do so, once this virus has been quashed and the world of expos and conventions is open once more for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the one hand&lt;/strong&gt;, I will be deciding to concentrate on game narrative and dynamics over game development techniques. For instance, how to progress a (the) game, make it interesting, consider issues of winning and losing - if this is actually necessary - or just seeing how far you can get as a player, with odds stacking up against you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the other&lt;/strong&gt;, I will be improving my programming skills in relation to hard game development techniques. For example, what’s a Lerp? How do Unity Vector3 transformations work, and why are they important (I know they are).  There’s an absolutely huge amount I do not know about, let alone how to make use of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these two seemingly separate identifiable areas for targeting my efforts and concentration do actually go hand-in-hand. I suppose it may be more productive to concentrate on the game itself, as in what it sets out to achieve, and how, and then to work on the techniques as they are required in order to achieve these aims, in a kind of &lt;strong&gt;form follows function&lt;/strong&gt; paradigm. The issue here is that I am not yet a master craftsman in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But.. I will only really learn by responding to need. I therefore propose to avoid the temptation to pivot, but to continue to develop the game towards an ideal agreed between myself and ShelterBox.  In so doing, I will look to incorporate techniques that are new to me, if and wherever possible - I will not seek to take the easy path just because it is available to me. &lt;strong&gt;Where I see more can be gained in the long-term through a litte hard work and an embracing of an experimental attitude, informed from the constraints and perspective of the brief, this is a path I will take.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">What gives?</summary></entry></feed>
